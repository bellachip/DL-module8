This heterogeneity affects key cancer pathways, driving phenotypic variation, and poses a significant challenge to personalized cancer medicine. A major cause of genetic heterogeneity in cancer is genomic instability. This instability leads to an increased mutation rate and can shape the evolution of the cancer genome through a plethora of mechanisms. By understanding these mechanisms we can gain insight into the common pathways of tumour evolution that could support the development of future therapeutic strategies.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,69.504

Patients presenting with advanced stage NSCLC die within 18-months of diagnosis. Metastatic spread accounts for >70% of these deaths. Thus elucidation of the mechanistic basis of NSCLC-metastasis has potential to impact on patient quality of life and survival. Research on NSCLC metastasis has recently expanded to include non-cancer cell components of tumors-the stromal cellular compartment and extra-cellular matrix components comprising the tumor-microenvironment. Metastasis (from initial primary tumor growth through angiogenesis, intravasation, survival in the bloodstream, extravasation and metastatic growth) is an inefficient process and few released cancer cells complete the entire process. Micro-environmental interactions assist each of these steps and discovery of the mechanisms by which tumor cells co-operate with the micro-environment are uncovering key molecules providing either biomarkers or potential drug targets. The major sites of NSCLC metastasis are brain, bone, adrenal gland and the liver. The mechanistic basis of this tissue-tropism is beginning to be elucidated offering the potential to target stromal components of these tissues thus targeting therapy to the tissues affected. This review covers the principal steps involved in tumor metastasis. The role of cell-cell interactions, ECM remodeling and autocrine/paracrine signaling interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding stroma is discussed. The mechanistic basis of lung cancer metastasis to specific organs is also described. The signaling mechanisms outlined have potential to act as future drug targets minimizing lung cancer metastatic spread and morbidity.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,13.608

Nrf2 is controlled through a complex transcriptional/epigenetic and post-translational network that ensures its activity increases during redox perturbation, inflammation, growth factor stimulation and nutrient/energy fluxes, thereby enabling the factor to orchestrate adaptive responses to diverse forms of stress. Besides mediating stress-stimulated induction of antioxidant and detoxification genes, Nrf2 contributes to adaptation by upregulating the repair and degradation of damaged macromolecules, and by modulating intermediary metabolism. In the latter case, Nrf2 inhibits lipogenesis, supports β-oxidation of fatty acids, facilitates flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, and increases NADPH regeneration and purine biosynthesis; these observations suggest Nrf2 directs metabolic reprogramming during stress.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,9.969

In evaluating response biomarkers, we found that low doses of fractionated radiotherapy led to PD-L1 upregulation on tumor cells in a variety of syngeneic mouse models of cancer. Notably, fractionated radiotherapy delivered in combination with αPD-1 or αPD-L1 mAbs generated efficacious CD8(+) T-cell responses that improved local tumor control, long-term survival, and protection against tumor rechallenge. These favorable outcomes were associated with induction of a tumor antigen-specific memory immune response. Mechanistic investigations showed that IFNγ produced by CD8(+) T cells was responsible for mediating PD-L1 upregulation on tumor cells after delivery of fractionated radiotherapy. Scheduling of anti-PD-L1 mAb was important for therapeutic outcome, with concomitant but not sequential administration with fractionated radiotherapy required to improve survival. Taken together, our results reveal the mechanistic basis for an adaptive response by tumor cells that mediates resistance to fractionated radiotherapy and its treatment failure. With attention to scheduling, combination immunoradiotherapy with radiotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 signaling blockade may offer an immediate strategy for clinical evaluation to improve treatment outcomes.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,11.036

There is a common perception that these relationships extrapolate directly as adverse prognostic factors after diagnosis, but evidence for this is lacking. The paper from Sclesinger et al. in this issue of the journal adds a new dimension to this debate focusing on relationships of post-diagnosis BMI (as a marker of the steady-state weight among survivors) and survival, and provides evidence on a decreased mortality risk among overweight (post-diagnosis BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2)) compared with normal weight (post-diagnosis BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)) CRC survivors-an example of an 'obesity paradox.' The observation of the 'obesity paradox' is well documented in the methodology literature, but perhaps, less familiar to the cancer readership. Three broad classes of explanation are posited: (1) the associations are true and plausible; (2) the associations are false and reflect methodological issues; or (3) the observations represent a specific form of selection bias, known as collider bias.

Nevertheless, delineation is still generally clinically performed with little if any machine assistance, even though it is both time-consuming and prone to interobserver variation. Currently available segmentation tools include those based on image greyscale interrogation, statistical shape modelling and body atlas-based methods. However, all too often these are not able to match the accuracy of the expert clinician, which remains the universally acknowledged gold standard. In this article we suggest that current methods are fundamentally limited by their lack of ability to incorporate essential human clinical decision-making into the underlying models. Hybrid techniques that utilise prior knowledge, make sophisticated use of greyscale information and allow clinical expertise to be integrated are needed. This may require a change in focus from automated segmentation to machine-assisted delineation. Similarly, new metrics of image quality reflecting fitness for purpose would be extremely valuable. We conclude that methods need to be developed to take account of the clinician's expertise and honed visual processing capabilities as much as the underlying, clinically meaningful information content of the image data being interrogated.

Telomeres need to be replicated in each cell cycle and protected from DNA-processing enzymes, tasks that cells execute using specialized protein complexes such as telomerase (that includes TERT), which aids in telomere maintenance and replication, and the shelterin complex, which protects chromosome ends. These complexes are also able to interact with a variety of other proteins, referred to as the telomere interactome, to fulfill their biological functions and control signaling cascades originating from telomeres. Given their essential role in genomic maintenance and cell-cycle control, germline mutations in telomere-regulating proteins and their interacting partners have been found to underlie a variety of diseases and cancer-predisposition syndromes. These syndromes can be characterized by progressively shortening telomeres, in which carriers can present with organ failure due to stem cell senescence among other characteristics, or can also present with long or unprotected telomeres, providing an alternative route for cancer formation.

For this, homologs must pair during meiosis. In a crowded nucleus where sequence homology is obscured by the enormous scale and packaging of the genome, partner alignment is no small task. Here we review the early stages of this process. Chromosomes first establish an initial docking site, usually at telomeres or centromeres. The acquisition of chromosome-specific patterns of binding factors facilitates homolog recognition. Chromosomes are then tethered to the nuclear envelope (NE) and subjected to nuclear movements that 'shake off' inappropriate contacts while consolidating homolog associations. Thereafter, homolog connections are stabilized by building the synaptonemal complex or its equivalent and creating genetic crossovers. Recent perspectives on the roles of these stages will be discussed.","|Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,8.386

Targeting BRAF is an effective therapy for advanced melanoma, but patients progress due to the development of resistance. This 'acquired resistance' is thought to be based on a minority of tumour cell populations that are resistant and will eventually re-establish tumour growth even in the presence of drug. In particular, mutations, amplifications or overexpression of genes encoding regulators of the MAPK pathway can confer this resistance, because it allows the melanoma cells to bypass inhibitor action by stimulating ERK activation through alternative routes. Furthermore, there are mechanisms that produce resistance by enhancing the tolerance of melanoma cells to the cytotoxic effects of the drug. These compensatory mechanisms can activate survival signals in the melanoma cells without reactivating ERK. Besides these cell-autonomous resistance mechanisms, stromal fibroblasts in the tumour microenvironment have been identified as a potential source of resistance, because these cells can produce growth factors that reactivate ERK through paracrine signalling. Understanding and further identifying mechanisms of resistance is crucial for the future treatment of advanced melanoma, because this can inform the design of improved therapies with more durable responses.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,25.832

These molecules can sometimes be used to diagnose or follow treatment of tumours or as a target for different immunotherapies. The 5T4 oncofoetal glycoprotein was identified by searching for shared surface molecules of human trophoblast and cancer cells with the rationale that they may function to allow survival of the foetus as a semi-allograft in the mother or a tumour in its host, potentially influencing growth, invasion or altered immune surveillance of the host. 5T4 tumour selective expression has stimulated the development of 5T4 vaccine, 5T4 antibody targeted-superantigen and 5T4 antibody-drug therapies through preclinical and into clinical studies. It is now apparent that 5T4 expression is a marker of the use (or not) of several cellular pathways relevant to tumour growth and spread. Thus 5T4 expression is mechanistically associated with the directional movement of cells through epithelial mesenchymal transition, facilitation of CXCL12/CXCR4 chemotaxis, blocking of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin while favouring non-canonical pathway signalling. These processes are highly regulated in development and in normal adult tissues but can contribute to the spread of cancer cells.

Topoisomerase II (Topo II) poisons such as etoposide can induce abortive DNA strand breaks in which Topo II remains covalently bound to a 5' DNA strand terminus via a phosphotyrosyl linker. Tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (Tdp2) is a recently discovered human 5'-tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase that repairs this topoisomerase-mediated DNA damage, thereby playing a central role in maintaining normal DNA topology in cells. Cellular depletion of Tdp2 has been shown to result in increased susceptibility and sensitivity to Topo II-induced DNA double-strand breaks, thereby revealing Tdp2 as a potentially attractive anticancer target. No drug-like inhibitors of Tdp2 have been identified to date, and assays suitable for high-throughput screening (HTS) have not been widely reported. Here we have identified a new and effective chromogenic substrate for Tdp2 and developed a homogeneous and robust HTS assay. A second novel Tdp2 assay was also developed to cross-validate hit matter identified from an HTS. In addition, a new and specific Tdp2 antibody is described. Together, these new tools will aid in the identification of novel Tdp2 inhibitors and the investigation of the role of Tdp2 in cancer.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,25.832

To date, an abundance of data have supported crucial roles of the tumour microenvironment (TME) in providing cancer cells with proliferative, migratory, survival and invasive propensities favouring the processes of tumourigenesis. The cancerous reactive stroma is frequently populated by a large number of myofibroblasts (MFs), which are activated, non-transformed fibroblasts expressing α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). MFs together with non-MF cells present in the tumour-associated stroma are collectively referred to as carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), one of the major stromal cell types recognised in various human carcinomas. Recruitment of fibroblasts and/or their progenitors to a tumour mass and their subsequent transdifferentiation into MFs, as well as ongoing maintenance of their activated state, are believed to be essential processes facilitating tumour progression. However, the complex networks of signalling pathways mediating the phenotypic conversion into CAFs, as well as those underlying their tumour-promoting interactions with other tumour-constituting cells, have yet to be fully explored. Histopathological confirmation of the presence of large numbers of CAF MFs within TME and their altered gene expression profiles are known to be associated with disease progression and to serve as independent negative prognostic factors for a wide range of tumour types. In this review, we examine the current evidence shedding light on the emerging roles of tumour-promoting CAFs, cells that are pivotal for epithelial cancer development and progression, and discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting these cells.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,11.846

Current radiotherapy planning margins for glioma are informed by historic data of recurrence patterns using radiological imaging or post-mortem studies. Radiotherapy planning for World Health Organization grade II-IV gliomas currently relies predominantly on T1-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences to identify the gross tumour volume (GTV). Isotropic margins are added empirically for each tumour type, usually without any patient-specific individualisation. We discuss novel imaging techniques that have the potential to influence radiotherapy planning, by improving definition of the tumour extent and its routes of invasion, thus modifying the GTV and allowing anisotropic expansion to a clinical target volume better reflecting areas at risk of recurrence. Identifying the relationships of tumour boundaries to important white matter pathways and eloquent areas of cerebral cortex could lead to reduced normal tissue complications. Novel magnetic resonance approaches to identify tumour extent and invasion include: (i) diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance metrics; (ii) diffusion tensor imaging; and (iii) positron emission tomography, using radiolabelled amino acids methyl-11C-L-methionine and 18F-fluoroethyltyrosine. Novel imaging techniques may also have a role together with clinical characteristics and molecular genetic markers in predicting response to therapy. Most significant among these techniques is dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, which uses dynamic acquisition of images after injection of intravenous contrast. A number of studies have identified changes in diffusion and microvascular characteristics occurring during the early stages of radiotherapy as powerful predictive biomarkers of outcome.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

Imaging can quantify the spatial variation in architecture and function of individual tumors through quantifying basic biophysical parameters such as CT density or MRI signal relaxation rate; through measurements of blood flow, hypoxia, metabolism, cell death, and other phenotypic features; and through mapping the spatial distribution of biochemical pathways and cell signaling networks using PET, MRI, and other emerging molecular imaging techniques. These methods can establish whether one tumor is more or less heterogeneous than another and can identify subregions with differing biology. In this article, we review the image analysis methods currently used to quantify spatial heterogeneity within tumors. We discuss how analysis of intratumor heterogeneity can provide benefit over more simple biomarkers such as tumor size and average function. We consider how imaging methods can be integrated with genomic and pathology data, instead of being developed in isolation. Finally, we identify the challenges that must be overcome before measurements of intratumoral heterogeneity can be used routinely to guide patient care.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,11.036

The fission yeast MAPK Sty1 (also known as Spc1 or Phh1) is highly activated in response to a variety of external stresses. To avoid segregation of damaged organelles or chromosomes, strong Sty1 activation transiently blocks mitosis and cell division until such stresses have been dealt with. MAPK phosphatases dephosphorylate Sty1 to reduce kinase activity. Therefore, tight control of MAPK phosphatases is central for stress adaptation and for cell division to resume. In contrast to Pyp1, the fission yeast Pyp2 MAPK phosphatase is under environmental control. Pyp2 has a unique sequence (the linker region) between the catalytic domain and the N-terminal MAPK-binding site. Here we show that the Pyp2 linker region is a destabilisation domain. Furthermore, the linker region is highly phosphorylated to increase Pyp2 protein stability and this phosphorylation is Sty1 dependent. Our data suggests that Sty1 activation promotes Pyp2 phosphorylation to increase the stability of the phosphatase. This MAPK-dependent Pyp2 stabilisation allows cells to attenuate MAPK signalling and resume cell division, once stresses have been dealt with.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,63.714

Depleting BICD1 increased the intracellular accumulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-activated TrkB and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) by disrupting the endosomal sorting, reducing lysosomal degradation and increasing the co-localisation of these neurotrophin receptors with retromer-associated sorting nexin 1. The resulting re-routing of active receptors increased their recycling to the plasma membrane and altered the repertoire of signalling-competent TrkB isoforms and p75(NTR) available for ligand binding on the neuronal surface. This resulted in attenuated, but more sustained, AKT activation in response to BDNF stimulation. These data, together with our observation that Bicd1 expression is restricted to the developing nervous system when neurotrophin receptor expression peaks, indicate that BICD1 regulates neurotrophin signalling by modulating the endosomal sorting of internalised ligand-activated receptors.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,14.012

However, dose-limiting side effects are observed, and MEK inhibitors that sufficiently reduce ERK activation in patients show a low clinical response. Apart from dose limitations, a reason for the low response to MEK targeting drugs is thought to be the upregulation of counteracting signalling cascades as a direct response to MEK inhibition. Therefore, understanding the biology of melanoma cells and the effects of MEK inhibition on these cells will help to identify new combinatorial approaches that are more potent and allow for lower concentrations of the drug being used. We have discovered that in melanoma cells MEK inhibition by selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) or PD184352, while efficiently suppressing proliferation, stimulates increased invasiveness. Inhibition of MEK suppresses actin-cortex contraction and increases integrin-mediated adhesion. Most importantly, and surprisingly, MEK inhibition results in a significant increase in matrix metalloproteases (MMP)-2 and membrane-type 1-MMP expression. All together, MEK inhibition in melanoma cells induces a 'mesenchymal' phenotype that is characterised by protease-driven invasion. This mode of invasion is dependent on integrin-mediated adhesion, and because SRC kinases are the main regulators of this process, the SRC kinase inhibitor, saracatinib (AZD0530), completely abolished the MEK inhibitor-induced invasion. Moreover, the combination of saracatinib and selumetinib effectively suppressed the growth and invasion of melanoma cells in a 3D environment, suggesting that combined inhibition of MEK and SRC is a promising approach to improve the efficacy of targeting the ERK/MAP kinase pathway in melanoma.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,8.756

In around 3-5% of cases FA is caused by biallelic mutations in the BRCA2 gene. Individuals heterozygous for BRCA2 mutations have an increased risk of inherited breast and ovarian cancer. We reviewed the mutation spectrum in BRCA2-associated FA, and the spectrum and frequency of BRCA2 mutations in distinct populations. The rarity of FA due to biallelic BRCA2 mutations supports a fundamental role of BRCA2 for prevention of malignant transformation during development. The spectrum of malignancies seen associated with FA support the concept of a tissue selectivity of BRCA2 mutations for development of FA-associated cancers. This specificity is illustrated by the distinct FA-associated BRCA2 mutations that appear to predispose to specific brain or haematological malignancies. For some populations, the number of FA-patients with biallelic BRCA2 disruption is smaller than that expected from the carrier frequency, and this implies that some pregnancies with biallelic BRCA2 mutations do not go to term. The apparent discrepancy between expected and observed incidence of BRCA2 mutation-associated FA in high-frequency carrier populations has important implications for the genetic counselling of couples with recurrent miscarriages from high-risk populations.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

Overall, while the development of reversible inhibitors to date has been less fruitful than that of irreversible inhibitors, there is still the possibility for their use to facilitate further research into the roles and functions of LSD1 and to expand the therapeutic applications of LSD1 inhibitors in the clinic.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,11.036

With the introduction of genome-wide association studies, 78 susceptibility loci (SNPs) associated with PrCa risk have been identified. Genetic profiling could risk-stratify a population, leading to the discovery of a higher proportion of clinically significant disease and a reduction in the morbidity related to age-based prostate-specific antigen screening.

In flies, as in mammals, the oscillator operates in cells that coexpress CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC). Recent work in Drosophila has shown that CLK is unique in its ability to generate heterologous oscillators, indicating that Clk gene expression defines the circadian cell fate. Here, using standard in vitro and in vivo techniques, we show that TWIN-OF-EYELESS (TOY; dPax6) regulates Clk expression in small ventrolateral neurons (s-LNvs) that coordinate sleep-wake cycles. Crucially, toy binds multiple sites at the Clk locus, is expressed independent of CLK-CYC in LNvs, regulates CLK protein levels under optimal photoperiodic conditions, and sets clock-speed during endogenous free-run. Furthermore, TOY is necessary for the onset of Clk expression in LNvs during embryogenesis. We propose that TOY contributes to a transcription complex that functions upstream of the oscillator to promote Clk expression in s-LNvs.",|Journal Article,"""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

Autophagy operates at basal levels to turn over damaged and misfolded proteins and it is the only process for the turnover of organelles. The process is therefore critically important for the preservation of cellular integrity and viability. Autophagy is also highly adaptable and the rate and cargoes of autophagy can be altered to bring about desired cellular responses to intracellular and environmental cues, disease states and a spectrum of pharmaceutical drugs. As a result, there is much interest in understanding the dynamics of autophagy in a variety of situations. To date, the majority of assays to monitor autophagy either measure changes in a parameter of the process at a set point in time or use markers/tracers to monitor flow of membrane-bound proteins from one point in the process to another. As such, these assays do not measure changes in endogenous cargo degradation which is the ultimate end-point of the autophagy process. We describe here an assay to measure autophagic cargo degradation by engineering cells to degrade mitochondria en masse. We show that this 'enhanced-mitophagy' assay can be used to measure differences in the rate of autophagy between different cells or in response to agents which are known to promote or inhibit autophagic flux. We consider therefore that this assay will prove to be a valuable resource for investigations in which autophagy is considered important and is believed to be modulated.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

The expansion of genetically distinct sub-clonal populations may explain the emergence of drug resistance, and if so, would have prognostic and predictive utility. However, methods for objectively quantifying tumour heterogeneity have been missing and are particularly difficult to establish in cancers where predominant copy number variation prevents accurate phylogenetic reconstruction owing to horizontal dependencies caused by long and cascading genomic rearrangements. To address these challenges, we present MEDICC, a method for phylogenetic reconstruction and heterogeneity quantification based on a Minimum Event Distance for Intra-tumour Copy-number Comparisons. Using a transducer-based pairwise comparison function, we determine optimal phasing of major and minor alleles, as well as evolutionary distances between samples, and are able to reconstruct ancestral genomes. Rigorous simulations and an extensive clinical study show the power of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in reconstruction accuracy, and additionally allows unbiased numerical quantification of tumour heterogeneity. Accurate quantification and evolutionary inference are essential to understand the functional consequences of tumour heterogeneity. The MEDICC algorithms are independent of the experimental techniques used and are applicable to both next-generation sequencing and array CGH data.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

Genomic analysis of isolated CTCs revealed considerable similarity to the corresponding CDX. Most marked differences were observed between CDXs from patients with different clinical outcomes. These data demonstrate that CTC molecular analysis via serial blood sampling could facilitate delivery of personalized medicine for SCLC.

The geometry of Marvin was generated from CT datasets of eight male and female patients lying in the treatment position, with removable inhomogeneities modelling the sinuses and mandible. A modular system allows the phantom to be used with a range of detectors, with the locations of the modules being based on an analysis of a range of typical treatment plans (27 in total) which were mapped onto the phantom geometry. Results demonstrate the use of Gafchromic EBT2/EBT3 film for measurement of relative dose in a plane through the target and organs-at-risk, and the use of a small-volume ionization chamber for measurement of absolute dose in the target and spinal cord. Measurements made during the development of the head and neck VMAT protocol at the Christie quantified the improvement in plan delivery resulting from the installation of the Elekta Integrity upgrade (which permits an effectively continuously variable dose rate), with plans delivered before and after the upgrade having 88.5 ± 9.4% and 98.0 ± 2.2% respectively of points passing a gamma analysis (at 4%, 4 mm, global). Audits of TomoTherapy and Varian RapidArc neck techniques at other institutions showed a similar quality of plan delivery as for post-Integrity Elekta VMAT: film measurements for both techniques had >99% of points passing a gamma analysis at the clinical criteria of 4%, 4 mm, global, and >95% of points passing at tighter criteria of 3%, 3 mm, global; and absolute dose measurements in the PTV and spinal cord were within 1.5% and 3.5% of the planned doses respectively for both techniques.

The possibilities of reproducing the original study results, performing further analyses on existing research data to generate new hypotheses or developing computational models to support medical decisions (e.g. risk/benefit analysis of treatment options) represent just a fraction of the potential benefits of medical data-pooling.

Although serine and glycine can be interconverted and either might be used for nucleotide synthesis and one-carbon metabolism, we show that exogenous glycine cannot replace serine to support cancer cell proliferation. Cancer cells selectively consumed exogenous serine, which was converted to intracellular glycine and one-carbon units for building nucleotides. Restriction of exogenous glycine or depletion of the glycine cleavage system did not impede proliferation. In the absence of serine, uptake of exogenous glycine was unable to support nucleotide synthesis. Indeed, higher concentrations of glycine inhibited proliferation. Under these conditions, glycine was converted to serine, a reaction that would deplete the one-carbon pool. Providing one-carbon units by adding formate rescued nucleotide synthesis and growth of glycine-fed cells. We conclude that nucleotide synthesis and cancer cell proliferation are supported by serine--rather than glycine--consumption.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,9.995

Overall, 71,527 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), enriched for association with breast cancer, were tested for interaction with 10 environmental risk factors using three recently proposed hybrid methods and a joint test of association and interaction. Analyses were adjusted for age, study, population stratification, and confounding factors as applicable. Three SNPs in two independent loci showed statistically significant association: SNPs rs10483028 and rs2242714 in perfect linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 21 and rs12197388 in ARID1B on chromosome 6. While rs12197388 was identified using the joint test with parity and with age at menarche (P-values = 3 × 10(-07)), the variants on chromosome 21 q22.12, which showed interaction with adult body mass index (BMI) in 8,891 postmenopausal women, were identified by all methods applied.

Phosphatase activity must subsequently be restored to promote mitotic exit. Although Cdc14 phosphatase drives this reversal in budding yeast, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activities have each been independently linked to mitotic exit control in other eukaryotes. Here we describe a mitotic phosphatase relay in which PP1 reactivation is required for the reactivation of both PP2A-B55 and PP2A-B56 to coordinate mitotic progression and exit in fission yeast. The staged recruitment of PP1 (the Dis2 isoform) to the regulatory subunits of the PP2A-B55 and PP2A-B56 (B55 also known as Pab1; B56 also known as Par1) holoenzymes sequentially activates each phosphatase. The pathway is blocked in early mitosis because the Cdk1-cyclin B kinase (Cdk1 also known as Cdc2) inhibits PP1 activity, but declining cyclin B levels later in mitosis permit PP1 to auto-reactivate. PP1 first reactivates PP2A-B55; this enables PP2A-B55 in turn to promote the reactivation of PP2A-B56 by dephosphorylating a PP1-docking site in PP2A-B56, thereby promoting the recruitment of PP1. PP1 recruitment to human, mitotic PP2A-B56 holoenzymes and the sequences of these conserved PP1-docking motifs suggest that PP1 regulates PP2A-B55 and PP2A-B56 activities in a variety of signalling contexts throughout eukaryotes.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,69.504

Depleting HUWE1 or mutating the TIAM1 ubiquitylation site prevents TIAM1 degradation, antagonizing scattering, and invasion. Moreover, simultaneous depletion of TIAM1 restores migration and invasion in HUWE1-depleted cells. Significantly, we show that HUWE1 stimulates human lung cancer cell invasion through regulating TIAM1 stability. Finally, we demonstrate that HUWE1 and TIAM1 protein levels are inversely correlated in human lung carcinomas. Thus, we elucidate a critical role for HUWE1 in regulating epithelial cell-cell adhesion and provide additional evidence that ubiquitylation contributes to spatiotemporal control of RAC.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,9.995

Therefore, selective pharmacological inhibition of TDP2 is proposed as a novel approach to overcome intrinsic or acquired resistance to topo II-targeted drug therapy. Following a high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign, toxoflavins and deazaflavins were identified as the first reported sub-micromolar and selective inhibitors of this enzyme. Toxoflavin derivatives appeared to exhibit a clear structure-activity relationship (SAR) for TDP2 enzymatic inhibition. However, we observed a key redox liability of this series, and this, alongside early in vitro drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) issues, precluded further exploration. The deazaflavins were developed from a singleton HTS hit.

Measuring changes in the levels of different phosphoinositides in animals is difficult, but it is essential in order to define the important functions of specific members of the phosphoinositide family. Here we detail procedures for measuring phosphoinositides in 2-days-postfertilization (2-d.p.f.) embryos in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Both in vivo radiolabeling (using [(32)P]orthophosphate) followed by thin-layer or high-performance liquid chromatography (TLC or HPLC) analysis and specific in vitro phosphorylation assays (using [(32)P]γATP) permit the quantitative measurement of phosphoinositides. Normalization of both measurements can be achieved by the determination of total lipid phosphate in embryos. All the techniques described are relatively inexpensive and accessible to most laboratories with an interest in studying the effect of gene manipulation on phosphoinositide metabolism in zebrafish.

Apc negatively regulates Wnt signalling but is also involved in organizing the cytoskeleton and may have a role in chromosome segregation. In vitro studies have implicated Apc in the control of genomic stability. However, the relevance of this data has been questioned in vivo as Apc is lost earlier than the onset of genomic instability. Here we analyse the relationship between immediate loss of Apc and the acquisition of genomic instability in hepatocytes. We used Cre-lox technology to inactivate Apc and in combination with p53 in vivo, to define the consequences of gene loss on cell cycle regulation, proliferation, death and aneuploidy. We show that, although Apc loss leads to increased proliferation, it also leads to increased apoptosis, the accumulation of p53, p21 and markers of double-strand breaks and DNA repair. Flow cytometry revealed an increased 4N DNA content, consistent with a G2 arrest. Levels of anaphase bridges were also elevated, implicating failed chromosome segregation. This was accompanied by an increase in centrosome number, which demonstrates a role for Apc in maintaining euploidy. To address the role of p53 in these processes, we analysed combined loss of Apc and p53, which led to a further increase in proliferation, cell death, DNA damages and repair and a bypass of G2 arrest than was observed with Apc loss. However, we observed only a marginal effect on anaphase bridges and centrosome number, which could be due to increased cell death. Our data therefore establishes, in an in vivo setting, that APC loss leads to a DNA damage signature and genomic instability in the liver and that additional loss of p53 leads to an increase in the DNA damage signal but not to an immediate increase in the genomic instability phenotype.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,8.756

One such mechanism, succination, is an irreversible non-enzymatic modification of cysteine residues by fumarate, to form S-(2-succino)cysteine (2SC).

Here, we report the structural characterization of the talin rod: 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) organized into a compact cluster of four-helix bundles (R2-R4) within a linear chain of five-helix bundles. Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins. As talin engages F-actin, force exerted on R2R3 disrupts RIAM binding and exposes the VBS, which recruit vinculin to stabilize the complex.","|Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,25.832

It acts by altering protein-protein interactions, protein localisation and protein activity. SUMO chains can also act as substrates for ubiquitination, resulting in proteasome-mediated degradation of the target protein. SUMO is removed from target proteins by one of a number of specific proteases. The processes of sumoylation and desumoylation have well documented roles in DNA metabolism and in the maintenance of chromatin structure. To further analyse the role of this modification, we have purified protein complexes containing the S. pombe SUMO protease, Ulp2. These complexes contain proteins required for ribosome biogenesis, RNA stability and protein synthesis. Here we have focussed on two translation initiation factors that we identified as co-purifying with Ulp2, eIF4G and eIF3h. We demonstrate that eIF4G, but not eIF3h, is sumoylated. This modification is increased under conditions that produce cytoplasmic stress granules. Consistent with this we observe partial co-localisation of eIF4G and SUMO in stressed cells. Using HeLa cells, we demonstrate that human eIF4GI is also sumoylated; in vitro studies indicate that human eIF4GI is modified on K1368 and K1588, that are located in the C-terminal eIF4A- and Mnk-binding sites respectively.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

EVI1 mediates transcriptional regulation, signalling, and epigenetic modifications by interacting with DNA, proteins and protein complexes. To explore to what extent protein phosphorylation impacts on EVI1 functions, we analysed endogenous EVI1 protein from a high EVI1 expressing Fanconi anaemia (FA) derived AML cell line. Mass spectrometric analysis of immunoprecipitated EVI1 revealed phosphorylation at serine 196 (S196) in the sixth zinc finger of the N-terminal zinc finger domain. Mutated EVI1 with an aspartate substitution at serine 196 (S196D), which mimics serine phosphorylation of this site, exhibited reduced DNA-binding and transcriptional repression from a gene promotor selectively targeted by the N-terminal zinc finger domain. Forced expression of the S196D mutant significantly reduced EVI1 mediated transformation of Rat1 fibroblasts. While EVI1-mediated serial replating of murine haematopoietic progenitors was maintained by EVI1-S196D, this was associated with significantly higher Evi1-trancript levels compared with WT-EVI1 or EVI1-S196A, mimicking S196 non-phosphorylated EVI1.

Insulin-stimulated PKB activation was strongly abrogated in the absence of extracellular glucose as a consequence of the loss of insulin-stimulated PI3K activation and short-term glucose deprivation inhibited subsequent tumour cell growth. Loss of insulin-stimulated PKB signalling and cell growth was rescued by extracellular glucosamine and increased flux through the HBP. Disruption of O-GlcNAc transferase activity, a terminal step in the HBP, implicated O-GlcNAcylation in PKB signalling and cell growth.

However, despite improvements in the progression-free survival, the benefit in overall survival is modest. Tumour angiogenesis is regulated by a number of angiogenic cytokines. Thus innate or acquired resistance to VEGF inhibitors can be caused, at least in part, through expression of other angiogenic cytokines, including fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and stromal-cell-derived factor 1α (SDF-1α), which make tumours insensitive to VEGF signalling pathway inhibition. The majority of angiogenic cytokines, including VEGF-A, FGF2, IL-8 and SDF-1α, manifest an obligate dependence on heparan sulfate (HS) for their biological activity. This mandatory requirement of angiogenic cytokines for HS identifies HS as a potential target for novel anti-angiogenic therapy. Targeting multiple angiogenic cytokines with HS mimetics may represent an opportunity to inhibit tumour angiogenesis more efficiently.

We have therefore mapped over 400 regions of consistent inadequate sequencing (cold-spots) in known cancer-causing genes and kinases, in 368 of which neither institute finds mutations.

We highlight that cross-referencing between genomic databases is required to comprehensively assess genomic alterations in commonly used cell lines and that there are still significant opportunities to identify novel drivers of tumorigenesis in poorly sequenced areas of the exome.

If clinical code lists are not available, reviewers are unable to determine the validity of research, full study replication is impossible, researchers are unable to make effective comparisons between studies, and the construction of new code lists is subject to much duplication of effort. Despite this, the publication of clinical codes is rarely if ever a requirement for obtaining grants, validating protocols, or publishing research. In a representative sample of 450 EMR primary research articles indexed on PubMed, we found that only 19 (5.1%) were accompanied by a full set of published clinical codes and 32 (8.6%) stated that code lists were available on request. To help address these problems, we have built an online repository where researchers using EMRs can upload and download lists of clinical codes. The repository will enable clinical researchers to better validate EMR studies, build on previous code lists and compare disease definitions across studies. It will also assist health informaticians in replicating database studies, tracking changes in disease definitions or clinical coding practice through time and sharing clinical code information across platforms and data sources as research objects.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

Hannover Wistar rats were dosed with 1.25 mg/kg DOX weekly for 8 weeks followed by a 4 week off-dosing ""recovery"" period. Electron microscopy of the myocardium revealed subcellular degeneration and marked mitochondrial changes after a single dose. Histopathological analysis revealed progressive cardiomyocyte degeneration, hypertrophy/cytomegaly, and extensive vacuolation after two doses. Extensive replacement fibrosis (quantified by Sirius red staining) developed during the off-dosing period. Functional indices assessed by cardiac MRI (including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac output, and E/A ratio) declined progressively, reaching statistical significance after two doses and culminating in ""clinical"" LV dysfunction by 12 weeks. Significant increases in peak myocardial contrast enhancement and serological cardiac troponin I (cTnI) emerged after eight doses, importantly preceding the LVEF decline to <50%. Troponin I levels positively correlated with delayed and peak gadolinium contrast enhancement, histopathological grading, and diastolic dysfunction. In summary, subcellular cardiomyocyte degeneration was the earliest marker, followed by progressive functional decline and histopathological manifestations. Myocardial contrast enhancement and elevations in cTnI occurred later. However, all indices predated ""clinical"" LV dysfunction and thus warrant further evaluation as predictive biomarkers.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,63.714

Basal expression was found in crypts and villi of the small and large intestine, bronchiolar epithelial cells, the epidermis and hair follicles, gall bladder epithelium, choroid plexus, and biliary epithelium. Expression was induced in different tissues by the antioxidant chemopreventive agents ethoxyquin and butylated hydroxyanisole. However, genetic deletion of the Nrf2 transcription factor, which directs central genetic programs of detoxification and protection against oxidative stress, increased rather than attenuated GSTP1 expression. In vitro investigations with mouse embryonic fibroblasts revealed factors, in addition to Nrf2, that control the expression of GSTP1, offering further insights into regulation.

The tool ensures consistent oligomer overlapping melting temperatures, minimizes the likelihood of misannealing, optimizes codon usage for expression in a selected host, allows for specification of forward and reverse cloning sequences (for downstream ligation) and also provides support for mutagenesis or directed evolution studies. Directed evolution studies are enabled through the construction of variant libraries via the optional specification of 'variant codons', containing mixtures of bases, at any position. For example, specifying the variant codon TNT (where N is any nucleotide) will generate an equimolar mixture of the codons TAT, TCT, TGT and TTT at that position, encoding a mixture of the amino acids Tyr, Ser, Cys and Phe. This facility is demonstrated through the use of GeneGenie to develop and synthesize a library of enhanced green fluorescent protein variants.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,11.036

We identified families where melanoma cosegregates with loss-of-function variants in the protection of telomeres 1 gene (POT1), with a proportion of family members presenting with an early age of onset and multiple primary tumors. We show that these variants either affect POT1 mRNA splicing or alter key residues in the highly conserved oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) domains of POT1, disrupting protein-telomere binding and leading to increased telomere length.

In France patients living between 20 and 90min from the nearest cancer unit tended to have a poorer survival, although this was not statistically significant. In England, the better prognosis observed for remote patients can be explained by associations with material deprivation; distance to health services alone did not affect survival whilst material deprivation level had a major influence, with lower survival for patients living in deprived areas.

There were differences within cell line cohorts relating to tissue of origin reflected by expression of the stratified epithelial marker p63. Of 138 genes identified as being associated with SF2, only 2 (1.4%) were congruent between the cervix and head and neck carcinoma cell lines (MGST1 and TFPI), and these did not partition the published NCI-60 cell lines based on SF2. There was variable success in applying three published radiosensitivity signatures to our cohorts. One gene signature, originally trained on the NCI-60 cell lines, did partially separate sensitive and resistant cell lines in all three cell line datasets.

We present a novel approach to ubiquitin detection based upon the dimethyl labeling of isopeptide N-termini glycines. Ubiquitinated proteins were digested with trypsin and the resulting peptide mixture was derivatized using formaldehyde-D2 solution and sodium cyanoborohydride. The dimethylated peptide mixtures were next separated by liquid chromatography and analyzed on a quadrupole-TOF based mass spectrometer. Diagnostic b2' and a1' ions released from the isopeptide N-terminus upon collision-induced dissociation (CID) were used to spectrally improve the identification of ubiquitinated isopeptides. Proof of principle was established by application to a ubiquitinated protein tryptic digest spiked into a six-protein mix digest background. Extracted ion chromatograms of the a1' and b2' diagnostic product ions from the diglycine tag resulted in a significant reduction in signal complexity and demonstrated a selectivity towards the identification of diglycine branched isopeptides. The method was further shown to be capable of identifying diglycine isopeptides resulting from in-gel tryptic digests of ubiquitin enriched material from a His-Ub transfected cell line.

Elongation is particularly affected, with RECQL5 depletion causing a striking increase in the average rate, concurrent with increased stalling, pausing, arrest, and/or backtracking (transcription stress). RECQL5 therefore controls the movement of RNAPII across genes. Loss of RECQL5 also results in the loss or gain of genomic regions, with the breakpoints of lost regions located in genes and common fragile sites.

Our previous studies have identified LIM-homeodomain (HD) transcription factors (TFs), expressed by developing neurons, that are specifically able to regulate ion channel gene expression. In this study, we use the technique of DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) to identify putative gene targets of four such TFs that are differentially expressed in Drosophila motoneurons. Analysis of targets for Islet (Isl), Lim3, Hb9, and Even-skipped (Eve) identifies both ion channel genes and genes predicted to regulate aspects of dendritic and axonal morphology. Significantly, some ion channel genes are bound by more than one TF, consistent with the possibility of combinatorial regulation. One such gene is Shaker (Sh), which encodes a voltage-dependent fast K(+) channel (Kv1.1). DamID reveals that Sh is bound by both Isl and Lim3. We used body wall muscle as a test tissue because in conditions of low Ca(2+), the fast K(+) current is carried solely by Sh channels (unlike neurons in which a second fast K(+) current, Shal, also contributes). Ectopic expression of isl, but not Lim3, is sufficient to reduce both Sh transcript and Sh current level. By contrast, coexpression of both TFs is additive, resulting in a significantly greater reduction in both Sh transcript and current compared with isl expression alone. These observations provide evidence for combinatorial activity of Isl and Lim3 in regulating ion channel gene expression.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,63.714

We also show that removal of the pku70+ and pku80+ genes, which encode DNA end binding proteins required for the non-homologous end joining DNA repair pathway, increases the efficiency of gene targeting at fin1+ to around 75-80% (a 16-fold increase). We describe how a natMX6/rpl42+ cassette can be used for positive and negative selection for integration at a targeted locus. To facilitate the evaluation of the impact of a series of mutations on the function of a gene of interest we have generated three vector series that rely upon different selectable markers to direct the expression of tagged/untagged molecules from distinct genomic integration sites. pINTL and pINTK vectors use ura4+ selection to direct disruptive integration of leu1+ and lys1+ respectively, while pINTH vectors exploit nourseothricin resistance to detect the targeted disruption of a hygromycin B resistance conferring hphMX6 cassette that has been integrated on chromosome III. Finally, we have generated a series of multi-copy expression vectors that use resistance to nourseothricin or kanamycin/G418 to select for propagation in prototrophic hosts. Collectively these protocol modifications and vectors extend the versatility of this key model system.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

We discovered that the immune microenvironment can act as a source of resistance to MAPK pathway-targeted therapy, and moreover during treatment this source becomes reinforced. In particular, we identified macrophage-derived TNFα as a crucial melanoma growth factor that provides resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors through the lineage transcription factor MITF (microphthalmia transcription factor). Most strikingly, in BRAF-mutant melanomas of patients and BRAF(V600E) melanoma allografts, MAPK pathway inhibitors increased the number of tumor-associated macrophages, and TNFα and MITF expression. Inhibiting TNFα signaling with IκB kinase inhibitors profoundly enhanced the efficacy of MAPK pathway inhibitors by targeting not only the melanoma cells but also the microenvironment. In summary, we identify the immune microenvironment as a novel source of resistance and reveal a new strategy to improve the efficacy of targeted therapy in melanoma.","|Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,38.272

There was pronounced intratumor heterogeneity in copy number alterations, translocations, and mutations associated with APOBEC cytidine deaminase activity. Despite maintained carcinogen exposure, tumors from smokers showed a relative decrease in smoking-related mutations over time, accompanied by an increase in APOBEC-associated mutations. In tumors from former smokers, genome-doubling occurred within a smoking-signature context before subclonal diversification, which suggested that a long period of tumor latency had preceded clinical detection.

Here, we identify Runx2 as a new regulator of epithelial cell fate in mammary gland development and breast cancer. Runx2 is expressed in the epithelium of pregnant mice in a strict temporally and hormonally regulated manner. During pregnancy, Runx2 genetic deletion impaired alveolar differentiation in a manner that disrupted alveolar progenitor cell populations. Conversely, exogenous transgenic expression of Runx2 in mammary epithelial cells blocked milk production, suggesting that the decrease in endogenous Runx2 observed late in pregnancy is necessary for full differentiation. In addition, overexpression of Runx2 drove epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-like changes in normal mammary epithelial cells, whereas Runx2 deletion in basal breast cancer cells inhibited cellular phenotypes associated with tumorigenesis. Notably, loss of Runx2 expression increased tumor latency and enhanced overall survival in a mouse model of breast cancer, with Runx2-deficient tumors exhibiting reduced cell proliferation. Together, our results establish a previously unreported function for Runx2 in breast cancer that may offer a novel generalized route for therapeutic interventions.

In contrast with DNA methylation, which occurs immediately during replication, hmC forms slowly during the first 30 hours following DNA synthesis. Isotopic labelling of DNA in mouse tissues confirmed the stability of hmC in vivo and demonstrated a relationship between global levels of hmC and cell proliferation.

O(6)-CMG has been identified in DNA derived from human colon tissue and its occurrence has been linked to diets high in red and processed meats, implying an association with the induction of colorectal cancer. By analogy to O(6)-methylguanine, O(6)-CMG is expected to be mutagenic, inducing G-to-A mutations that may be the molecular basis of increased cancer risk. Previously, the crystal structure of the DNA dodecamer d(CGCG[O(6)-CMG]ATTCGCG) has been reported, in which O(6)-CMG forms a Watson-Crick-type pair with thymine similar to the canonical A:T pair. In order to further investigate the versatility of O(6)-CMG in base-pair formation, the structure of the DNA dodecamer d(CGC[O(6)-CMG]AATTTGCG) containing O(6)-CMG at a different position has been determined by X-ray crystallography using four crystal forms obtained under conditions containing different solvent ions (Sr(2+), Ba(2+), Mg(2+), K(+) or Na(+)) with and without Hoechst 33258. The most striking finding is that the pairing modes of O(6)-CMG with T are quite different from those previously reported. In the present dodecamer, the T bases are displaced (wobbled) into the major groove to form a hydrogen bond between the thymine N(3) N-H and the carboxyl group of O(6)-CMG. In addition, a water molecule is bridged through two hydrogen bonds between the thymine O(2) atom and the 2-amino group of O(6)-CMG to stabilize the pairing. These interaction modes commonly occur in the four crystal forms, regardless of the differences in crystallization conditions. The previous and the present results show that O(6)-CMG can form a base pair with T in two alternative modes: the Watson-Crick type and a high-wobble type, the nature of which may depend on the DNA-sequence context.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

TTC5 is a stress-inducible transcription cofactor known to interact directly with the histone acetyltransferase EP300 to augment the TP53 response. Knockdown (KD) of TTC5 induced apoptosis of both murine and human AML cells, with concomitant loss of clonogenic and leukemia-initiating potential; KD of EP300 elicited a similar phenotype. Consistent with the physical interaction of TTC5 and EP300, the onset of apoptosis following KD of either gene was preceded by reduced expression of BCL2 and increased expression of pro-apoptotic genes. Forced expression of BCL2 blocked apoptosis and partially rescued the clonogenic potential of AML cells following TTC5 KD. KD of both genes also led to the accumulation of MYC, an acetylation target of EP300, and the form of MYC that accumulated exhibited relative hypoacetylation at K148 and K157, residues targeted by EP300. In view of the ability of excess cellular MYC to sensitize cells to apoptosis, our data suggest a model whereby TTC5 and EP300 cooperate to prevent excessive accumulation of MYC in AML cells and their sensitization to cell death. They further reveal a hitherto unappreciated role for TTC5 in leukemic hematopoiesis.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,9.685

We show that UHRF1 exists in distinct active states, binding either unmodified H3 or the H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) modification. A polybasic region (PBR) in the C terminus blocks interaction of a tandem tudor domain (TTD) with H3K9me3 by occupying an essential peptide-binding groove. In this state the plant homeodomain (PHD) mediates interaction with the extreme N terminus of the unmodified H3 tail. Binding of the phosphatidylinositol phosphate PI5P to the PBR of UHRF1 results in a conformational rearrangement of the domains, allowing the TTD to bind H3K9me3.

Oxidative stress regulates the activity of the cell survival factor PKB, through the regulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃ synthesis. Whether oxidative stress regulates other phosphoinositides to control PKB activation is not clear. Here we show that PtdIns5P is a redox-regulated second messenger. In response to hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), we measured an increase in PtdIns5P in cells derived from human osteosarcoma, U2OS (5-fold); breast tumors, MDA-MB-468 (2-fold); and fibrosarcoma, HT1080 (3-fold); and in p53-null murine embryonic fibroblasts (8-fold). In U2OS cells, the increase in H₂O₂-dependent PtdIns5P did not require mTOR, PDK1, PKB, ERK, and p38 signaling or PIKfyve, a lipid kinase that increases PtdIns5P in response to osmotic and oncogenic signaling. A reduction in H₂O₂-induced PtdIns5P levels by the overexpression of PIP4K revealed its role in PKB activation. Suppression of H₂O₂-induced PtdIns5P generation reduced PKB activation and, surprisingly, reduced cell sensitivity to growth inhibition by H₂O₂. These data suggest that inhibition of PIP4K signaling might be useful as a novel strategy to increase the susceptibility of tumor cells to therapeutics that function through increased oxidative stress.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

MiRNAs are key regulators of several biological processes, acting by influencing the post-transcriptional regulation of numerous targets, thus making miRNAs potential candidates in cancer initiation. Here we have defined novel epithelial as well as stromal miRNA signatures from columnar cell hyperplasia lesions compared to normal terminal duct lobular units by using microdissection and miRNA microarrays. Let-7c were among the identified downregulated epithelial miRNAs and its functions were delineated in unique CCH derived cells and breast cancer cell line MCF-7 suggesting anti-proliferative traits potentially due to effects on Myb and ERα. MiR-132 was upregulated in the stroma surrounding CCH compared to stoma surrounding normal terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs), and overexpression of miR-132 in immortalized fibroblasts and in fibroblasts co-cultured with epithelial CCH cells caused substantial expression changes of genes involved in metabolism, DNA damage and cell motility. The miRNA signatures identified in CCH indicate early changes in the epithelial and stromal compartment of CCH and could represent early key alterations in breast cancer progression that potentially could be targeted in novel prevention or treatment schedules.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

Although individual mutations in bound sequence motifs can influence TF binding, most binding differences occur in the absence of nearby sequence variations. Instead, combinatorial binding was found to be significant for genetic and evolutionary stability; cobound TFs tend to disappear in concert and were sensitive to genetic knockout of partner TFs.

Given the potential therapeutic applications of OECs, understanding their biology is crucial. We have identified two distinct OEC populations based on differential expression of the cell surface marker CD34. OEC colonies lacked CD34 expression (CD34-), expressed CD34 in the majority of cells (CD34+), or showed a mixed expression pattern within a colony (CD34+/-). CD34+ and CD34- OECs were negative for hematopoietic cell marker CD45 and expressed the endothelial cell surface markers CD31, CD146, CD105, and VEGFR-2. Functionally CD34- and CD34+ OECs exhibited strikingly distinct behaviors. CD34- OECs, unlike CD34+ OECs, were capable of sprouting, formed tubes, and responded to angiogenic growth factors in vitro. In vivo, CD34- OECs formed endothelial tubes, while CD34+ OECs, despite being unable to form tubes, promoted infiltration of murine vasculature. Global gene expression profiling in CD34- and CD34+ OECs identified functional importance of the MMP-1/PAR-1 pathway in CD34- OECs. MMP-1 stimulated the expression of VEGFR-2, neuropilin-1, neuropilin-2, and CXCR4 and activated ERK1/2, whereas down-regulation of PAR-1 in CD34- OECs resulted in impaired angiogenic responses in vitro and reduced VEGFR-2 levels. In contrast, the CD34+ OEC colonies expressed high levels of the progenitor cell marker ALDH, which was absent in CD34- OECs. In summary, we show that OECs can be classified into functionally mature endothelial cells (CD34- OECs) that depend on the MMP-1/PAR-1 pathway and progenitor-like angiogenesis-promoting cells (CD34+ OECs).","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,10.658

Pharmacodynamic biomarkers to define the optimum dose of drug that provokes tumor apoptosis are in demand; acquisition of longitudinal tumor biopsies is a significant challenge and minimally invasive biomarkers are required. Considering this, we have developed and validated a preclinical 'death-switch' model for the discovery of secreted biomarkers of tumour apoptosis using in vitro proteomics and in vivo evaluation of the novel imaging probe [(18)F]ML-10 for non-invasive detection of apoptosis using positron emission tomography (PET). The 'death-switch' is a constitutively active mutant caspase-3 that is robustly induced by doxycycline to drive synchronous apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells in vitro or grown as tumor xenografts. Death-switch induction caused caspase-dependent apoptosis between 3 and 24 hours in vitro and regression of 'death-switched' xenografts occurred within 24 h correlating with the percentage of apoptotic cells in tumor and levels of an established cell death biomarker (cleaved cytokeratin-18) in the blood. We sought to define secreted biomarkers of tumor apoptosis from cultured cells using Discovery Isobaric Tag proteomics, which may provide candidates to validate in blood. Early after caspase-3 activation, levels of normally secreted proteins were decreased (e.g. Gelsolin and Midkine) and proteins including CD44 and High Mobility Group protein B1 (HMGB1) that were released into cell culture media in vitro were also identified in the bloodstream of mice bearing death-switched tumors. We also exemplify the utility of the death-switch model for the validation of apoptotic imaging probes using [(18)F]ML-10, a PET tracer currently in clinical trials. Results showed increased tracer uptake of [(18)F]ML-10 in tumours undergoing apoptosis, compared with matched tumour controls imaged in the same animal.

Here we showed, using two prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and PC-3) and primary astrocytes, that the anticancer/cytotoxic effects of ascorbate are completely abolished by iron at physiological concentrations in cell culture medium and human plasma. A detailed examination of mechanisms showed that iron at physiological concentrations promotes both production and decomposition of H2O2. The latter is mediated by Fenton reaction and prevents H2O2 accumulation. The hydroxyl radical, which is produced in the Fenton reaction, is buffered by extracellular proteins, and could not affect intracellular targets like H2O2.

Multiple mechanisms regulate Rac1 activity including its ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation. Here, we identify the tumour suppressor HACE1 (HECT domain and Ankyrin repeat Containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase 1) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for Rac1 degradation following activation by a migration stimulus. We show that HACE1 and Rac1 interaction is enhanced by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signalling, a Rac activator and potent stimulus of cell migration. Furthermore, HACE1 catalyses the poly-ubiquitylation of Rac1 at lysine 147 following its activation by HGF, resulting in its proteasomal degradation. This negative feedback mechanism likely restricts cell motility. Consistent with this, HACE1 depletion is accompanied by increased total Rac1 levels and accumulation of Rac1 in membrane ruffles. Moreover, HACE1-depletion enhances cell migration independently of growth factor stimulation, which may have significance for malignant conversion. A non-ubiquitylatable Rac1 rescues the migration defect of Rac1-null cells to a greater extent than wild-type Rac1. These findings identify HACE1 as an antagonist of cell migration through its ability to degrade active Rac1.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,8.756

Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling can promote cell survival and is upregulated in solid tumor types, including colorectal cancer (CRC), although these effects are context dependent. The role of PI3K in tumorigenesis combined with their amenability to specific inhibition makes them attractive drug targets. However, we observed that inhibition of PI3K in HCT116, DLD-1, and SW620 CRC cells did not induce apoptotic cell death. Moreover, these cells were relatively resistant to the Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3) mimetic ABT-737, which directly targets the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators. To test the hypothesis that PI3K inhibition lowers the apoptotic threshold without causing apoptosis per se, PI3K inhibitors were combined with ABT-737. PI3K inhibition enhanced ABT-737-induced apoptosis by 2.3- to 4.5-fold and reduced expression levels of MCL-1, the resistance biomarker for ABT-737. PI3K inhibition enhanced ABT-737-induced apoptosis a further 1.4- to 2.4-fold in CRC cells with small interfering RNA-depleted MCL-1, indicative of additional sensitizing mechanisms. The observation that ABT-737-induced apoptosis was unaffected by inhibition of PI3K downstream effectors AKT and mTOR, implicated a novel PI3K-dependant pathway. To elucidate this, an RNA interference (RNAi) screen of potential downstream effectors of PI3K signaling was conducted, which demonstrated that knockdown of the TEC kinase BMX sensitized to ABT-737. This suggests that BMX is an antiapoptotic downstream effector of PI3K, independent of AKT.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

Kinases are a substantial and important subset of clients requiring the key cochaperone CDC37. We sought an improved understanding of protein kinase chaperoning by CDC37 in cancer cells. CDC37 overexpression in human colon cancer cells increased CDK4 protein levels, which was negated upon CDC37 knockdown. Overexpressing CDC37 increased CDK4 protein half-life and enhanced binding of HSP90 to CDK4, consistent with CDC37 promoting kinase loading onto chaperone complexes. Against expectation, expression of C-terminus-truncated CDC37 (ΔC-CDC37) that lacks HSP90 binding capacity did not affect kinase client expression or activity; moreover, as with wild-type CDC37 overexpression, it augmented CDK4-HSP90 complex formation. However, although truncation blocked binding to HSP90 in cells, ΔC-CDC37 also showed diminished client protein binding and was relatively unstable. CDC37 mutants with single and double point mutations at residues M164 and L205 showed greatly reduced binding to HSP90, but retained association with client kinases. Surprisingly, these mutants phenocopied wild-type CDC37 overexpression by increasing CDK4-HSP90 association and CDK4 protein levels in cells. Furthermore, expression of the mutants was sufficient to protect kinase clients CDK4, CDK6, CRAF and ERBB2 from depletion induced by silencing endogenous CDC37, indicating that CDC37's client stabilising function cannot be inactivated by substantially reducing its direct interaction with HSP90. However, CDC37 could not compensate for loss of HSP90 function, showing that CDC37 and HSP90 have their own distinct and non-redundant roles in maintaining kinase clients. Our data substantiate the important function of CDC37 in chaperoning protein kinases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CDC37 can stabilise kinase clients by a mechanism that is not dependent on a substantial direct interaction between CDC37 and HSP90, but nevertheless requires HSP90 activity. These results have significant implications for therapeutic targeting of CDC37.","|Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,8.756

Here we show that budding yeast Hof1 also contributes to actin ring assembly in parallel with the Rvs167 protein. Simultaneous deletion of the HOF1 and RVS167 genes is lethal, and cells fail to assemble the actomyosin ring as they progress through mitosis. Although Hof1 and Rvs167 are not orthologues, they both share an analogous structure, with an F-BAR or BAR domain at the amino terminus, capable of inducing membrane curvature, and SH3 domains at the carboxyl terminus that bind to specific proline-rich targets. The SH3 domain of Rvs167 becomes essential for assembly of the actomyosin ring in cells lacking Hof1, suggesting that it helps to recruit a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. This new function of Rvs167 appears to be independent of its known role as a regulator of the Arp2/3 actin nucleator, as actin ring assembly is not abolished by the simultaneous inactivation of Hof1 and Arp2/3. Instead we find that recruitment to the bud-neck of the Iqg1 actin regulator is defective in cells lacking Hof1 and Rvs167, though future studies will be needed to determine if this reflects a direct interaction between these factors. The redundant role of Hof1 in actin ring assembly suggests that the mechanism of actin ring assembly has been conserved to a greater extent across evolution than anticipated previously.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

The most common somatic mutation in melanoma is a V600E substitution in BRAF, which is an early event. To investigate how UVR accelerates oncogenic BRAF-driven melanomagenesis, we used a BRAF(V600E) mouse model. In mice expressing BRAF(V600E) in their melanocytes, a single dose of UVR that mimicked mild sunburn in humans induced clonal expansion of the melanocytes, and repeated doses of UVR increased melanoma burden. Here we show that sunscreen (UVA superior, UVB sun protection factor (SPF) 50) delayed the onset of UVR-driven melanoma, but only provided partial protection. The UVR-exposed tumours showed increased numbers of single nucleotide variants and we observed mutations (H39Y, S124F, R245C, R270C, C272G) in the Trp53 tumour suppressor in approximately 40% of cases. TP53 is an accepted UVR target in human non-melanoma skin cancer, but is not thought to have a major role in melanoma. However, we show that, in mice, mutant Trp53 accelerated BRAF(V600E)-driven melanomagenesis, and that TP53 mutations are linked to evidence of UVR-induced DNA damage in human melanoma. Thus, we provide mechanistic insight into epidemiological data linking UVR to acquired naevi in humans. Furthermore, we identify TP53/Trp53 as a UVR-target gene that cooperates with BRAF(V600E) to induce melanoma, providing molecular insight into how UVR accelerates melanomagenesis.

Here, our data demonstrate, contrary to established dogma, that loss of haematopoietic-derived focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is sufficient to enhance tumour metastasis. Using both experimental and spontaneous metastasis models, we show that genetic ablation of haematopoietic FAK does not affect primary tumour growth but enhances the incidence of metastasis significantly. At a molecular level, haematopoietic FAK deletion results in an increase in PU-1 levels and decrease in GATA-1 levels causing a shift of hematopoietic homeostasis towards a myeloid commitment. The subsequent increase in circulating granulocyte number, with an increase in serum CXCL12 and granulocyte CXCR4 levels, was required for augmented metastasis in mice lacking haematopoietic FAK. Overall our findings provide a mechanism by which haematopoietic FAK controls cancer metastasis.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,17.694

Our understanding of immune function has benefited greatly from mouse models allowing for selective ablation of DCs. Many such models rely on transgenic diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) expression driven by DC-restricted promoters. This renders DCs sensitive to DT but is otherwise thought to have no effect on immune physiology. In this study, we report that, unexpectedly, mice in which DTR is expressed on conventional DCs display marked lymph node (LN) hypocellularity and reduced frequency of DCs in the same organs but not in spleen or nonlymphoid tissues. Intriguingly, in mixed bone marrow chimeras the phenotype conferred by DTR-expressing DCs is dominant over control bone marrow-derived cells, leading to small LNs and an overall paucity of DCs independently of the genetic ability to express DTR. The finding of alterations in LN composition and size independently of DT challenge suggests that caution must be exercised when interpreting results of experiments obtained with mouse models to inducibly deplete DCs. It further indicates that DTR, a member of the epidermal growth factor family, is biologically active in mice. Its use in cell ablation experiments needs to be considered in light of this activity.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

Data from assisted reproduction programmes provides additional evidence that this is largely mediated at the level of embryonic competence and is highly heterogeneous among embryos. Understanding the basis of this heterogeneity has important implications in a number of areas including: the regulation of early human development, disorders of pregnancy, assisted reproduction programmes, the long term health of children which may be programmed in early development, and the molecular basis of pluripotency in human stem cell populations. We have therefore investigated global gene expression profiles using polyAPCR amplification and microarray technology applied to individual human oocytes and 4-cell and blastocyst stage embryos. In order to explore the basis of any variability in detail, each developmental stage is replicated in triplicate. Our data show that although transcript profiles are highly stage-specific, within each stage they are relatively variable. We describe expression of a number of gene families and pathways including apoptosis, cell cycle and amino acid metabolism, which are variably expressed and may be reflective of embryonic developmental competence. Overall, our data suggest that heterogeneity in human embryo developmental competence is reflected in global transcript profiles, and that the vast majority of existing human embryo gene expression data based on pooled oocytes and embryos need to be reinterpreted.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

These reprogrammed cells were stably expanded on stromal cells and possessed short-term reconstitution ability in vivo. Loss of p53 function facilitated reprogramming to blood, and p53(-/-) reprogrammed cells efficiently generated erythroid, megakaryocytic, myeloid, and lymphoid lineages. Genome-wide analyses revealed that generation of hematopoietic progenitors was preceded by the appearance of hemogenic endothelial cells expressing endothelial and hematopoietic genes.

Aurora-A is a mitotic Ser/Thr protein kinase that has two regulatory phosphorylation sites on its activation loop, T287 and T288. While phosphorylation of T288 is known to activate the kinase, the function of T287 phosphorylation is unclear. We applied site-directed mutagenesis and selective chemical modification to specifically introduce bioisosteres for phospho-threonine and other unnatural amino acids at these positions. Modified Aurora-A proteins were characterized using a biochemical assay measuring substrate phosphorylation. Replacement of T288 with glutamate and aspartate weakly stimulated activity. Phospho-cysteine, installed by chemical synthesis from a corresponding cysteine residue introduced at position 288, showed catalytic activity approaching that of the comparable phospho-serine protein. Unnatural amino acid residues, with longer side chains, inserted at position 288 were autophosphorylated and supported substrate phosphorylation. Aurora-A activity is enhanced by phosphorylation at position 287 alone but is suppressed when position 288 is also phosphorylated. This is rationalized by competition between phosphorylated T287 and T288 for a binding site composed of arginines, based on a structure of Aurora-A in which phospho-T287 occupies this site. This is, to our knowledge, the first example of a Ser/Thr kinase whose activity is controlled by the phosphorylation state of adjacent residues in its activation loop. Overall we demonstrate an approach that combines mutagenesis and selective chemical modification of selected cysteine residues to investigate otherwise impenetrable aspects of kinase regulation.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,25.832

The Gad8 kinase (AKT homologue) phosphorylates fission yeast Tor1 at this threonine (T1972) to reduce activity. A T1972A mutation that blocked phosphorylation increased Tor1 activity and stress resistance. Nitrogen starvation of fission yeast inhibited TOR signaling to arrest cell cycle progression in G1 phase and promoted sexual differentiation. Starvation and a Gad8/T1972-dependent decrease in Tor1 (TORC2) activity was essential for efficient cell cycle arrest and differentiation. Experiments in human cell lines recapitulated these yeast observations, as mTOR was phosphorylated on T2173 in an AKT-dependent manner. In addition, a T2173A mutation increased mTOR activity.

In addition, we show that this pathway is necessary to facilitate resolution of retained catenanes in mitosis. When delayed by catenation in mitosis, inhibition of PKCε results in premature entry into anaphase with PICH-positive strands and chromosome bridging.

This article highlights the potential for the approach, but also underlies some of the key hurdles that remain to be overcome in order to produce a functional antibody-based screening approach that is able to identify novel tumor antigens that can be recognized by CAR T cells.","|Comment|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

Here we investigate the role played by ncRNAs in the stress response of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We integrate global proteomics and RNA sequencing data to identify a systematic programme in which elevated antisense RNA arising both from ncRNAs and from 3'-overlapping convergent gene pairs is directly associated with substantial reductions in protein levels throughout the genome. We describe an extensive array of ncRNAs with trans associations that have the potential to influence multiple pathways. Deletion of one such locus reduces levels of atf1, a transcription factor downstream of the stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and alters sensitivity to oxidative stress. These non-coding transcripts therefore regulate specific stress responses, adding unanticipated information-processing capacity to the MAPK signalling system.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,17.694

Here we report that the physical elasticity of lymph nodes is maintained in part by podoplanin (PDPN) signalling in stromal fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) and its modulation by CLEC-2 expressed on dendritic cells. We show in mouse cells that PDPN induces actomyosin contractility in FRCs via activation of RhoA/C and downstream Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). Engagement by CLEC-2 causes PDPN clustering and rapidly uncouples PDPN from RhoA/C activation, relaxing the actomyosin cytoskeleton and permitting FRC stretching. Notably, administration of CLEC-2 protein to immunized mice augments lymph node expansion. In contrast, lymph node expansion is significantly constrained in mice selectively lacking CLEC-2 expression in dendritic cells. Thus, the same dendritic cells that initiate immunity by presenting antigens to T lymphocytes also initiate remodelling of lymph nodes by delivering CLEC-2 to FRCs. CLEC-2 modulation of PDPN signalling permits FRC network stretching and allows for the rapid lymph node expansion--driven by lymphocyte influx and proliferation--that is the critical hallmark of adaptive immunity.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,69.504

Here, we demonstrate that inducible NFI recruitment permits PARP1 binding to the FOS promoter by a mutually reinforcing loop. PARP1 and its poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity are required for maintaining FOS activation kinetics. We also show that the histone variant H2A.Z associates with the FOS promoter and acts in a transcription-suppressive manner. However, in response to ERK pathway signalling, H2A.Z is replaced by H2A; PARP1 activity is required to promote this exchange.

The Rho-like GTPase Rac has been implicated in Ras-induced neoplastic transformation. Moreover, a recurrent UV-induced mutation activating RAC1 has recently been detected in human melanoma. Here, a role for Rac in melanoma initiation and progression was investigated in human melanomas and zebrafish models of melanocyte neoplasia. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed RAC expression and activity restricted to melanocytes at the junction of the epidermis and dermis in benign neoplasms. Malignant melanocytes displayed elevated RAC activity that extended into the suprabasal epidermis, deeper into the dermis, and was maintained in metastases. Previously, we have used zebrafish transgenic models to demonstrate that deregulated Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling can initiate melanocyte neoplasia. Expression of a constitutively active RAC1 mutant (V12RAC1) was not sufficient to initiate melanocyte neoplasia in this organism. Furthermore, we did not detect an additive effect when combined with V600EBRAF, nor could V12RAC1 substitute for suppressed Pi3k signaling to restore melanoma progression. However, coexpression of V12RAC1 and oncogenic RAS accelerated tumor nodule formation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the Rac activator Tiam1 (T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1) is overexpressed in melanoma tumor nodules in both zebrafish and humans. Thus, our data suggest that Rac contributes to the progression of melanoma and that Tiam1 may activate Rac in nodular presentations.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

We investigated the role of this pathway using the JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib (RUX). We demonstrated that the combination of RUX, at clinically achievable concentrations, with the specific and potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib, reduced the activity of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway in vitro relative to either single agent alone.

Notably, we identified the succination of three cysteine residues in mitochondrial Aconitase2 (ACO2) crucial for iron-sulfur cluster binding. We show that fumarate exerts a dose-dependent inhibition of ACO2 activity, which correlates with increased succination as determined by mass spectrometry, possibly by interfering with iron chelation. Importantly, we show that aconitase activity is impaired in FH-deficient cells.

Here we demonstrate that a targeted genetic dependency screen is an efficient approach to identify somatic cancer alterations that are functionally important. By using this approach, we have identified three kinases with gain-of-function mutations in lung cancer, namely FGFR4, MAP3K9, and PAK5. Mutations in these kinases are activating toward the ERK pathway, and targeted depletion of the mutated kinases inhibits proliferation, suppresses constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways, and results in specific killing of the lung cancer cells. Genomic profiling of patients with lung cancer is ushering in an era of personalized medicine; however, lack of actionable mutations presents a significant hurdle.

In this paper, we identify a novel PKB/Akt substrate, RacGAP1, which is phosphorylated as a consequence of RCP-dependent α5β1 trafficking. Phosphorylation of RacGAP1 promotes its recruitment to IQGAP1 at the tips of invasive pseudopods, and RacGAP1 then locally suppresses the activity of the cytoskeletal regulator Rac and promotes the activity of RhoA in this subcellular region. This Rac to RhoA switch promotes the extension of pseudopodial processes and invasive migration into FN-containing matrices, in a RhoA-dependent manner. Thus, the localized endocytic trafficking of α5β1 within the tips of invasive pseudopods elicits signals that promote the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, protrusion, and invasion into FN-rich ECM.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,8.077

It has been suggested that rounded-amoeboid cancer cells do not require matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to invade. Here we compare MMP levels in rounded-amoeboid and elongated-mesenchymal melanoma cells. Surprisingly, we find that rounded-amoeboid melanoma cells secrete higher levels of several MMPs, including collagenase MMP-13 and gelatinase MMP-9. As a result, rounded-amoeboid melanoma cells degrade collagen I more efficiently than elongated-mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, using a non-catalytic mechanism, MMP-9 promotes rounded-amoeboid 3D migration through regulation of actomyosin contractility via CD44 receptor. MMP-9 is upregulated in a panel of rounded-amoeboid compared with elongated-mesenchymal melanoma cell lines and its levels are controlled by ROCK-JAK-STAT3 signalling. MMP-9 expression increases during melanoma progression and it is particularly prominent in the invasive fronts of lesions, correlating with cell roundness. Therefore, rounded-amoeboid cells use both catalytic and non-catalytic activities of MMPs for invasion.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,17.694

One hypothesis is that red meat facilitates the nitrosation of bile acid conjugates and amino acids, which rapidly convert to DNA-damaging carcinogens. Indeed, the toxic and mutagenic DNA adduct O(6)-carboxymethylguanine (O(6)-CMG) is frequently present in human DNA, increases in abundance in people with high levels of dietary red meat and may therefore be a causative factor in CRC. Previous reports suggested that O(6)-CMG is not a substrate for the human version of the DNA damage reversal protein O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which protects against the genotoxic effects of other O(6)-alkylguanine lesions by removing alkyl groups from the O(6)-position. We now show that synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing the known MGMT substrate O(6)-methylguanine (O(6)-MeG) or O(6)-CMG effectively inactivate MGMT in vitro (IC50 0.93 and 1.8 nM, respectively). Inactivation involves the removal of the O(6)-alkyl group and its transfer to the active-site cysteine residue of MGMT. O(6)-CMG is therefore an MGMT substrate, and hence MGMT is likely to be a protective factor in CRC under conditions where O(6)-CMG is a potential causative agent.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,11.036

The ultimate consequence of this endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition is the concomitant activation of the hematopoietic program and downregulation of the endothelial program. However, due to the rare and transient nature of the HE, little is known about the initial role of RUNX1 within this population. We, therefore, developed and implemented a highly sensitive DNA adenine methyltransferase identification-based methodology, including a novel data analysis pipeline, to map early RUNX1 transcriptional targets in HE cells. This novel transcription factor binding site identification protocol should be widely applicable to other low abundance cell types and factors. Integration of the RUNX1 binding profile with gene expression data revealed an unexpected early role for RUNX1 as a positive regulator of cell adhesion- and migration-associated genes within the HE. This suggests that RUNX1 orchestrates HE cell positioning and integration prior to the release of hematopoietic cells. Overall, our genome-wide analysis of the RUNX1 binding and transcriptional profile in the HE provides a novel comprehensive resource of target genes that will facilitate the precise dissection of the role of RUNX1 in early blood development.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,25.476

How chromatin dynamics are regulated to facilitate this process in chromatin is still under exploration. We show here that a histone H2A variant, Htz1 (H2A.Z), in nucleosomes has a positive function in promoting efficient NER in yeast. Htz1 inherently enhances the occupancy of the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 on chromatin to promote histone H3 acetylation after UV irradiation. Consequently, this results in an increased binding of a NER protein, Rad14, to damaged DNA. Cells without Htz1 show increased UV sensitivity and defective removal of UV-induced DNA damage in the Htz1-bearing nucleosomes at the repressed MFA2 promoter, but not in the HMRa locus where Htz1 is normally absent. Thus, the effect of Htz1 on NER is specifically relevant to its presence in chromatin within a damaged region. The chromatin accessibility to micrococcal nuclease in the MFA2 promoter is unaffected by HTZ1 deletion. Acetylation on previously identified lysines of Htz1 plays little role in NER or cell survival after UV. In summary, we have identified a novel aspect of chromatin that regulates efficient NER, and we provide a model for how Htz1 influences NER in Htz1 nucleosomes.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,11.036

In breast cancer, CXCR4 signalling has been reported to be a mediator of metastasis, and is linked to poor prognosis. However its role in normal and malignant breast stem cell function has not been investigated. Anoikis resistant (AR) cells were collected from immortalised (MCF10A, 226L) and malignant (MCF7, T47D, SKBR3) breast cell lines and assessed for stem cell enrichment versus unsorted cells. AR cells had significantly higher mammosphere forming efficiency (MFE) than unsorted cells. The AR normal cells demonstrated increased formation of 3D structures in Matrigel compared to unsorted cells. In vivo, SKBR3 and T47D AR cells had 7- and 130-fold enrichments for tumour formationrespectively, compared with unsorted cells. AR cells contained significantly elevated CXCR4 transcript and protein levels compared to unsorted cells. Importantly, CXCR4 mRNA was higher in stem cell-enriched CD44+/CD24- patient-derived breast cancer cells compared to non-enriched cells. CXCR4 stimulation by its ligand SDF-1 reduced MFE of the normal breast cells lines but increased the MFE in T47D and patient-derived breast cancer cells. CXCR4 inhibition by AMD3100 increased stem cell activity but reduced the self-renewal capacity of the malignant breast cell line T47D. CXCR4+ FACS sorted MCF7 cells demonstrated a significantly increased MFE compared with CXCR4- cells. This significant increase in MFE was further demonstrated in CXCR4 over-expressing MCF7 cells which also had an increase in self-renewal compared to parental cells. A greater reduction in self-renewal following CXCR4 inhibition in the CXCR4 over-expressing cells compared with parental cells was also observed. Our data establish for the first time that CXCR4 signalling has contrasting effects on normal and malignant breast stem cell activity. Here, we demonstrate that CXCR4 signalling specifically regulates breast cancer stem cell activities and may therefore be important in tumour formation at the sites of metastases.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

Here, we identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5 as a key component of ATM activation in response to IR. UBR5 interacts with ATMIN and catalyzes ubiquitination of ATMIN at lysine 238 in an IR-stimulated manner, which decreases ATMIN interaction with ATM and promotes MRN-mediated signaling. We show that UBR5 deficiency, or mutation of ATMIN lysine 238, prevents ATMIN dissociation from ATM and inhibits ATM and NBS1 foci formation after IR, thereby impairing checkpoint activation and increasing radiosensitivity. Thus, UBR5-mediated ATMIN ubiquitination is a vital event for ATM pathway selection and activation in response to DNA damage.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,63.714

Here, we demonstrate that a phosphorylated form of the BH3-only protein Bid regulates apoptosis if mitotic exit is delayed. Bid is phosphorylated on serine 66 as cells enter mitosis, and this phosphorylation is lost during the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Cells expressing a nonphosphorylatable version of Bid or a BH3-domain mutant were resistant to mitotic-arrest-induced apoptosis.

The mechanisms governing this finely tuned regulation of viral latency are unknown. Here we show that mRNAs encoding gammaherpesviral maintenance proteins contain within their open reading frames clusters of unusual structural elements, G-quadruplexes, which are responsible for the cis-acting regulation of viral mRNA translation. By studying the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) mRNA, we demonstrate that destabilization of G-quadruplexes using antisense oligonucleotides increases EBNA1 mRNA translation. In contrast, pretreatment with a G-quadruplex-stabilizing small molecule, pyridostatin, decreases EBNA1 synthesis, highlighting the importance of G-quadruplexes within virally encoded transcripts as unique regulatory signals for translational control and immune evasion.

FACT does not associate with the Mcm2-7 helicase at replication origins during G1 phase but is subsequently incorporated into the replisome progression complex independently of histone binding and uniquely among histone chaperones.

Interest is mounting in tankyrase inhibitors (TNKSi), which destabilize β-catenin through stabilizing Axin. Here, we confirm that TNKSi inhibit Wnt-induced transcription, similarly to carnosate, which reduces the transcriptional activity of β-catenin by blocking its binding to BCL9, and attenuates intestinal tumors in Apc(Min) mice. By contrast, β-catenin's activity is unresponsive to TNKSi in colorectal cancer cells and in cells after prolonged Wnt stimulation. This TNKSi insensitivity is conferred by β-catenin's association with LEF1 and BCL9-2/B9L, which accumulate during Wnt stimulation, thereby providing a feed-forward loop that converts transient into chronic β-catenin signaling. This limits the therapeutic value of TNKSi in colorectal carcinomas, most of which express high LEF1 levels. Our study provides proof-of-concept that the successful inhibition of oncogenic β-catenin in colorectal cancer requires the targeting of its interaction with LEF1 and/or BCL9/B9L, as exemplified by carnosate.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,11.036

This increased efficacy corresponds with improved engineering of the chimeric receptors with the latest-generation receptors eliciting greater signaling and proliferation potential. However, the antigen-binding single-chain variable fragment (scFv) domain of the receptors is critical in determining the activity of the chimeric receptor-expressing T cells, as this determines specificity and affinity to the tumor antigen. In this study, we describe a mammalian T cell line screening protocol employing a 2A-based bicistronic retroviral vector to isolate functional scFvs. This approach involves expression of the scFv library in a chimeric antigen receptor, and is based on selection of clones capable of stimulating CD69 upregulation in a T cell line and has a number of advantages over previously described methods in that the use of a 2A cassette ensures the exclusion of nonexpressing scFvs and the screening using a chimeric receptor in a mammalian T cell line ensures selection in the optimum context for therapeutic use. Proof-of-principle experiments show that the protocol was capable of a 10(5)-fold enrichment of positive clones after three rounds of selection. Furthermore, an antigen-specific clone was successfully isolated from a partially enriched scFv library, confirming the strength of the protocol. This approach has the potential to identify novel scFvs of use in adoptive T cell therapy and, potentially, wider antibody-based applications.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

In order to investigate this we analysed a collection of uropathogenic Escherichia coli. The selected strains had previously undergone extensive characterisation using classical microbiological methods for a variety of metabolic tests and virulence factors. These bacteria were analysed using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy; gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after derivatisation of polar non-volatile analytes; as well as reversed-phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry in both positive (LC-MS(+ve)) and negative (LC-MS(-ve)) electrospray ionisation modes. A comparison of the discriminatory ability of these four methods with the metabolic test and virulence factors was made using Procrustes transformations to ascertain which methods produce congruent results. We found that FT-IR and LC-MS(-ve), but not LC-MS(+ve), were comparable with each other and gave highly similar clustering compared with the virulence factors tests. By contrast, FT-IR and LC-MS(-ve) were not comparable to the metabolic tests, and we found that the GC-MS profiles were significantly more congruent with the metabolic tests than the virulence determinants. We conclude that metabolomics investigations may be biased to the analytical platform that is used and reflects the chemistry employed by the methods. We therefore consider that multiple platforms should be employed where possible and that the analyst should consider that there is a danger of false correlations between the analytical data and the biological characteristics of interest if the full metabolome has not been measured.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

Evidence in the invasive breast indicates that breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) are radiotherapy-resistant and are capable of re-initiating a tumor recurrence; hence, targeting CSCs in high risk DCIS patient may improve survival. HER2 is overexpressed in 20% of DCIS and is known to be highly active in breast CSCs; we therefore investigated the effect of Lapatinib on DCIS CSC activity using 2 in vitro culture systems. Two DCIS cell lines DCIS.com (HER2 normal) and SUM225 (HER2 overexpressed) as well as DCIS cells from patient samples (n = 18) were cultured as mammospheres to assess CSC activity and in differentiated 3D-matrigel culture to determine effects within the non-CSCs. Mammosphere formation was reduced regardless of HER2 status, although this was more marked within the HER2-positive samples. When grown as differentiated DCIS acini in 3D-matrigel culture, Lapatinib only reduced acini size in the HER2-positive samples via decreased proliferation. Further investigation revealed lapatinib did not reduce self-renewal activity in the CSC population, but their proliferation was decreased regardless of HER2 status. In conclusion we show Lapatinib can reduce DCIS CSC activity, suggesting that the use of Lapatinib in high-risk DCIS patients has the potential to reduce recurrence and the progression of DCIS to invasive disease.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,66.85

Importantly, PIP4K2A is also required for the clonogenic potential of primary human AML cells. Its KD results in accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN1A and CDKN1B, G₁ cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Both CDKN1A accumulation and apoptosis were partially dependent on activation of the mTOR pathway. Critically, however, PIP4K2A KD in normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, both murine and human, did not adversely impact either clonogenic or multilineage differentiation potential, indicating a selective dependency that we suggest may be the consequence of the regulation of different transcriptional programs in normal versus malignant cells.

In vitro, up to 80% of tumour cells underwent apoptotic cell death within 24 h and death was accompanied by the release of potential 'danger signal' molecules HMGB1 and HSP90. In vivo, death switch induction provoked rapid, pronounced tumour regression in immune-competent and immune-deficient mice, but sustained tumour eradication was observed only in immune-competent mice. Moreover, the majority of mice that were tumour free after death switch induction were protected from further tumour rechallenge. In addition, long-term remission after induction of the death switch was completely abrogated following depletion of CD8 T cells. These data suggest that sustained tumour eradication after substantial tumour apoptosis requires an antitumour host immune response that prevents tumour relapse. In many patients, cancer therapies produce encouraging initial responses that are only short lived. These results provide new insights that may have important implications for further development of strategies that result in long-term tumour clearance after initially effective anticancer treatment.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,12.067

For this purpose, mammospheres from two ER-positive breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and T47D) were grown in suspension using low-attachment plates and directly compared to attached monolayer cells grown in parallel. This allowed us to identify a subset of proteins that were selectively over-expressed in mammospheres, relative to epithelial monolayers. We focused on mitochondrial proteins, as they appeared to be highly upregulated in both MCF7 and T47D mammospheres. Key mitochondrial-related enzymes involved in beta-oxidation and ketone metabolism were significantly upregulated in mammospheres, as well as proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, and specific protein inhibitors of autophagy/mitophagy. Overall, we identified >40 ""metabolic targets"" that were commonly upregulated in both MCF7 and T47D mammospheres. Most of these ""metabolic targets"" were also transcriptionally upregulated in human breast cancer cells in vivo, validating their clinical relevance. Based on this analysis, we propose that increased mitochondrial biogenesis and decreased mitochondrial degradation could provide a novel mechanism for the accumulation of mitochondrial mass in cancer stem cells. To functionally validate our observations, we utilized a specific MCT1/2 inhibitor (AR-C155858), which blocks the cellular uptake of two types of mitochondrial fuels, namely ketone bodies and L-lactate. Our results indicate that inhibition of MCT1/2 function effectively reduces mammosphere formation, with an IC-50 of ~1 µM, in both ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cell lines. Very similar results were obtained with oligomycin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial ATP synthase. Thus, the proliferative clonal expansion of cancer stem cells appears to require oxidative mitochondrial metabolism, related to the re-use of monocarboxylic acids, such as ketones or L-lactate. Our findings have important clinical implications for exploiting mitochondrial metabolism to eradicate cancer stem cells and to prevent recurrence, metastasis and drug resistance in cancer patients. Importantly, a related MCT1/2 inhibitor (AZD3965) is currently in phase I clinical trials in patients with advanced cancers: http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01791595.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

We report that intravenous delivery of the novel small molecule TLR7 agonist, DSR-6434, leads to the induction of type 1 interferon and activation of T and B lymphocytes, NK and NKT cells. Our data demonstrate that systemic administration of DSR-6434 enhances the efficacy of ionizing radiation (IR) and leads to improved survival in mice bearing either CT26 or KHT tumors. Of the CT26 tumor-bearing mice that received combined therapy, 55% experienced complete tumor resolution. Our data reveal that these long-term surviving mice have a significantly greater frequency of tumor antigen specific CD8(+) T cells when compared to age-matched tumor-naïve cells. To evaluate therapeutic effects on spontaneous metastases, we showed that combination of DSR-6434 with local IR of the primary tumor significantly reduced metastatic burden in the lung, when compared to time-matched cohorts treated with IR alone. The data demonstrate that systemic administration of the novel TLR7 agonist DSR-6434 in combination with IR primes an antitumor CD8(+) T-cell response leading to improved survival in syngeneic models of colorectal carcinoma and fibrosarcoma. Importantly, efficacy extends to sites outside of the field of irradiation, reducing metastatic load.

PIP4K2B has been linked to the regulation of gene transcription, to TP53 and AKT activation, and to the regulation of cellular reactive oxygen accumulation. However, its role in human tumor development and on patient survival is not known. Here, we have interrogated the expression of PIP4K2B in a cohort (489) of patients with breast tumor using immunohistochemical staining and by a meta-analysis of gene expression profiles from 2,999 breast tumors, both with associated clinical outcome data. Low PIP4K2B expression was associated with increased tumor size, high Nottingham histological grade, Ki67 expression, and distant metastasis, whereas high PIP4K2B expression strongly associated with ERBB2 expression. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that both high and low PIP4K2B expression correlated with poorer patient survival compared with intermediate expression. In normal (MCF10A) and tumor (MCF7) breast epithelial cell lines, mimicking low PIP4K2B expression, using short hairpin RNA interference-mediated knockdown, led to a decrease in the transcription and expression of the tumor suppressor protein E-cadherin (CDH1). In MCF10A cells, knockdown of PIP4K2B enhanced TGF-β-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process required during the development of metastasis. Analysis of gene expression datasets confirmed the association between low PIP4K2B and low CDH1expression. Decreased CDH1 expression and enhancement of TGF-β-induced EMT by reduced PIP4K2B expression might, in part, explain the association between low PIP4K2B expression and poor patient survival.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,11.036

Scenarios varied according to non-vaccination risk (low, medium and high) and 'risk target' (oneself, one's child or, as a comparator, one's elderly parent). Participants were more willing to vaccinate their child (61% acceptance) than themselves (54%) or their parent (56%).

Presently there is no test with the required performance to predict which healthy first-time mothers will go on to develop PE. The high specificity, sensitivity, and multiplexed nature of selected reaction monitoring holds great potential as a tool for the verification and validation of putative candidate biomarkersfor disease states. Realization of this potential involves establishing a high throughput, cost effective, reproducible sample preparation workflow. We have developed a semi-automated HPLC-based sample preparation workflow before a label-free selected reaction monitoring approach. This workflow has been applied to the search for novel predictive biomarkers for PE. To discover novel candidate biomarkers for PE, we used isobaric tagging to identify several potential biomarker proteins in plasma obtained at 15 weeks gestation from nulliparous women who later developed PE compared with pregnant women who remained healthy. Such a study generates a number of ""candidate"" biomarkers that require further testing in larger patient cohorts. As proof-of-principle, two of these proteins were taken forward for verification in a 100 women (58 PE, 42 controls) using label-free SRM. We obtained reproducible protein quantitation across the 100 samples and demonstrated significant changes in protein levels, even with as little as 20% change in protein concentration. The SRM data correlated with a commercial ELISA, suggesting that this is a robust workflow suitable for rapid, affordable, label-free verification of which candidate biomarkers should be taken forward for thorough investigation. A subset of pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) had value as novel predictive markers for PE.","|Clinical Trial|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Validation Study","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,66.85

South Asian ethnicity was assigned to patients recorded in the population-based National Cancer Registry of England during 1986-2004, using the computerized algorithm SANGRA: South Asian Names and Groups Recognition Algorithm. Population denominators were derived from population censuses. Multivariable flexible (splines) Poisson models were used to estimate trends and socioeconomic differentials in incidence in South Asians compared to non-South Asians. Overall, age-adjusted cancer incidence in South Asians was half that in non-South Asians but rose over time. Cancer-specific incidence trends and patterns by age and deprivation differed widely between the two ethnic groups. In contrast to non-South Asians, lung cancer incidence in South Asians did not fall. Colorectal and breast cancer incidence rose in both groups, more steeply in South Asians though remaining less common than in non-South Asians. The deprivation gaps in cancer-specific incidence were much less marked among South Asians, explaining some of the ethnic differences in overall incidence. Although still lower than in non-South Asians, cancer incidence is rising in South Asians, supporting the concept of transition in cancer incidence among South Asians living in England.

The detection of L1-specific cross-neutralizing antibodies in these sera using pseudovirions of types phylogenetically-related to those targeted by the L1 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines was also consistent between the two assays.

Further, the neutralizing antibody titers measured with the FC-PBNA correlated with those determined with the L2-PBNA, another modification of the L1-PBNA that spacio-temporally separates primary and secondary receptor engagement, as well as the protective titers measured using passive transfer studies in the murine genital-challenge model. In sum, the FC-PBNA provided sensitive measurement for both L1 VLP and L2-specific neutralizing antibody in human sera.

Curcuminoids were detectable in nine of 24 plasma samples, 24 of 24 urine samples, and in the colonic mucosa of all 23 biopsied participants. Mean tissue levels were 48.4 μg/g (127.8 nmol/g) of parent curcuminoids. The major conjugate, curcumin glucuronide, was detectable in 29 of 35 biopsies. High levels of topical curcumin persisted in the mucosa for up to 40 hours postadministration. Sixteen participants (67%) stated that they would take curcumin long-term should it be of proven benefit. In summary, pharmacologically active levels of curcumin were recovered from colonic mucosa. The regimen used here seems safe, and patients support its use in long-term trials.","|Clinical Trial|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,11.036

Here we demonstrate that Plk4, a protein kinase known as a master regulator of centriole formation, is also essential for spindle assembly in the absence of centrioles. Depletion of maternal Plk4 prevents nucleation and growth of microtubules and results in monopolar spindle formation. This leads to cytokinesis failure and, consequently, developmental arrest. We show that Plk4 function depends on its kinase activity and its partner protein, Cep152. Moreover, tethering Cep152 to cellular membranes sequesters Plk4 and is sufficient to trigger spindle assembly from ectopic membranous sites. Thus, the Plk4-Cep152 complex has an unexpected role in promoting microtubule nucleation in the vicinity of chromosomes to mediate bipolar spindle formation in the absence of centrioles.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,13.417

However, the driving force behind this migration is unknown. Possibilities include mitotic pressure, active movement driven by motility cues, or negative pressure arising from cell loss at the crypt collar. It is possible that a combination of factors together coordinate migration. Here, three different computational models are used to provide insight into the mechanisms that underpin cell movement in the crypt, by examining the consequence of eliminating cell division on cell movement. Computational simulations agree with existing experimental results, confirming that migration can continue in the absence of mitosis. Importantly, however, simulations allow us to infer mechanisms that are sufficient to generate cell movement, which is not possible through experimental observation alone. The results produced by the three models agree and suggest that cell loss due to apoptosis and extrusion at the crypt collar relieves cell compression below, allowing cells to expand and move upwards. This finding suggests that future experiments should focus on the role of apoptosis and cell extrusion in controlling cell migration in the crypt.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

However, commonly used retroviral vector-based genetic modification requires T cells to be driven into cell division; this potent mitogenic stimulus is associated with the development of an effector phenotype that may adversely impact upon the long-term engraftment potential and subsequent antitumor effects of T cells. To investigate whether the cytokines used during culture impact upon the engraftment potential of gene-modified T cells, a humanized model employing T cells engrafted with a MART-1-specific T cell receptor adoptively transferred into NOD/Shi-scid IL-2rγ(-/-) (NSG) immune-deficient mice bearing established melanoma tumors was used to compare the effects of the common γ chain cytokines IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 upon gene-modified T cell activity. MART-1-specific T cells cultured in IL-7 and IL-15 demonstrated greater relative in vitro proliferation and viability of T cells compared with the extensively used IL-2. Moreover, the IL-15 culture prolonged the survival of animals bearing melanoma tumors after adoptive transfer. However, the combination of IL-7 and IL-15 produced T cells with improved engraftment potential compared with IL-15 alone; however, a high rate of xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease prevented the identification of a clear improvement in antitumor effect of these T cells. These results clearly demonstrate modulation of gene-modified T cell engraftment in the NSG mouse, which supports the future testing of the combination of IL-7 and IL-15 in adoptive cell therapy protocols; however, this improved engraftment is also associated with the long-term maintenance of xenoreactive T cells, which limits the ultimate usefulness of the NSG mouse model in this situation.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

To determine whether the second-generation CAR was essential for optimal antitumor activity, two CD28-based CAR constructs targeting CD19 were tested for their ability to redirect mouse T cell function against established B cell lymphoma in a BALB/c syngeneic model system. T cells armed with either CAR eliminated A20 B cell lymphoma in vivo; however, one construct induced a T cell dose-dependent acute toxicity associated with a raised serum Th1 type cytokine profile on transfer into preconditioned mice. Moreover, a chronic toxicity manifested as granuloma-like formation in spleen, liver, and lymph nodes was observed in animals receiving T cells bearing either CD28 CAR, albeit with different kinetics dependent upon the specific receptor used. This phenotype was associated with an expansion of CD4+ CAR+ T cells and CD11b+ Gr-1(+) myeloid cells and increased serum Th2-type cytokines, including IL-10 and IL-13. Mouse T cells engrafted with a first-generation CAR failed to develop such autotoxicity, whereas toxicity was not apparent when T cells bearing the same receptors were transferred into C57BL/6 or C3H animals. In summary, the adoptive transfer of second-generation CD19-specific CAR T cells can result in a cell dose-dependent acute toxicity, whereas the prolonged secretion of high levels of Th2 cytokines from these CAR T cells in vivo drives a granulomatous reaction resulting in chronic toxicity. Strategies that prevent a prolonged Th2-cytokine biased CAR T cell response are clearly warranted.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

We also identified a novel phosphorylation event in hematopoietic progenitor cells that correlated with motile response and governed by the chemotactic factor CXCL12. The novel phosphorylation site on PTPRC/CD45; a protein tyrosine phosphatase, was validated by raising an antibody to the site and also using a mass spectrometry absolute quantification strategy. Site directed mutagenesis and inhibitor studies demonstrated that this single phosphorylation site governs hematopoietic progenitor cell and lymphoid cell motility, lies downstream from Rac proteins and potentiates Src signaling.

Typically these values cover about 10%-20% of all data and can originate from various backgrounds, including analytical, computational, as well as biological. Currently, the most well known substitute for missing values is a mean imputation. In fact, some researchers consider this aspect of data analysis in their metabolomics pipeline as so routine that they do not even mention using this replacement approach. However, this may have a significant influence on the data analysis output(s) and might be highly sensitive to the distribution of samples between different classes. Therefore, in this study we have analysed different substitutes of missing values namely: zero, mean, median, k-nearest neighbours (kNN) and random forest (RF) imputation, in terms of their influence on unsupervised and supervised learning and, thus, their impact on the final output(s) in terms of biological interpretation. These comparisons have been demonstrated both visually and computationally (classification rate) to support our findings. The results show that the selection of the replacement methods to impute missing values may have a considerable effect on the classification accuracy, if performed incorrectly this may negatively influence the biomarkers selected for an early disease diagnosis or identification of cancer related metabolites. In the case of GC-MS metabolomics data studied here our findings recommend that RF should be favored as an imputation of missing value over the other tested methods. This approach displayed excellent results in terms of classification rate for both supervised methods namely: principal components-linear discriminant analysis (PC-LDA) (98.02%) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) (97.96%) outperforming other imputation methods.",|Journal Article,"""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

Centrosomes control the internal spatial organization of somatic cells, and as such contribute to cell division, cell polarity and migration. Upon exiting the cell cycle, most cell types in the human body convert their centrioles into basal bodies, which drive the assembly of primary cilia, involved in sensing and signal transduction at the cell surface. Centrosomal genes are targeted by mutations in numerous human developmental disorders, ranging from diseases exclusively affecting brain development, through global growth failure syndromes to diverse pathologies associated with ciliary malfunction. Despite our much-improved understanding of centrosome function in cellular processes, we know remarkably little of its role in the organismal context, especially in mammals.

Evidence suggests that prognostic signatures in estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)) breast cancer define tumors with CIN and high proliferative potential. Intriguingly, CIN induction in lower eukaryotic cells and human cells is context dependent, typically resulting in a proliferation disadvantage but conferring a fitness benefit under strong selection pressures. We hypothesized that CIN permits accelerated genomic evolution through the generation of diverse DNA copy-number events that may be selected during disease development. In support of this hypothesis, we found evidence for selection of gene amplification of core regulators of proliferation in CIN-associated cancer genomes. Stable DNA copy-number amplifications of the core regulators TPX2 and UBE2C were associated with expression of a gene module involved in proliferation. The module genes were enriched within prognostic signature gene sets for ER(+) breast cancer, providing a logical connection between CIN and prognostic signature expression. Our results provide a framework to decipher the impact of intratumor heterogeneity on key cancer phenotypes, and they suggest that CIN provides a permissive landscape for selection of copy-number alterations that drive cancer proliferation.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,11.036

The Hippo signaling pathway has been proposed to sense tissue architecture and cell density via an intimate coupling with the polarity and cell contact machineries. The apical polarity protein Crumbs (Crb) controls the activity of Yorkie (Yki)/Yes-activated protein, the progrowth target of the Hippo pathway core kinase cassette, both in flies and mammals. The apically localized Four-point-one, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin domain protein Expanded (Ex) regulates Yki by promoting activation of the kinase cascade and by directly tethering Yki to the plasma membrane. Crb interacts with Ex and promotes its apical localization, thereby linking cell polarity with Hippo signaling. We show that, as well as repressing Yki by recruiting Ex to the apical membrane, Crb promotes phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Ex. We identify Skp/Cullin/F-box(Slimb/β-transducin repeats-containing protein) (SCF(Slimb/β-TrCP)) as the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex responsible for Ex degradation. Thus, Crb is part of a homeostatic mechanism that promotes Ex inhibition of Yki, but also limits Ex activity by inducing its degradation, allowing precise tuning of Yki function.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,63.714

Despite their resulting pleiotropic effects on multiple oncogenic pathways and hallmark traits of cancer, resistance to HSP90 inhibitors is possible and their ability to induce apoptosis is less than might be expected. Using an isogenic model for BAX knockout in HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells, we demonstrate the induction of BAX-dependent apoptosis at pharmacologically relevant concentrations of the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG both in vitro and in tumor xenografts in vivo. Removal of BAX expression by homologous recombination reduces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo but allows a lower level of cell death via a predominantly necrotic mechanism. Despite reducing apoptosis, the loss of BAX does not alter the overall sensitivity to 17-AAG in vitro or in vivo. The results indicate that 17-AAG acts predominantly to cause a cytostatic antiproliferative effect rather than cell death and further suggest that BAX status may not alter the overall clinical response to HSP90 inhibitors. Other agents may be required in combination to enhance tumor-selective killing by these promising drugs.

In the case of the insoluble drug (flurbiprofen) the samples mechanical properties were not altered when the drug was incorporated, however the sample stability and peptide release were.

This article and accompanying poster aim to provide a summary of the initiators, pathways and roles of senescence, as well as present examples of senescence and a possible use for senescence in therapy.","|Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,63.714

Here we show that Lgl also relocalizes to the cytoplasm at mitosis in epithelial cells, which divide symmetrically. The Aurora A and B kinases directly phosphorylate Lgl to promote its mitotic relocalization, whereas aPKC kinase activity is required only for polarization of Lgl. A form of Lgl that is a substrate for aPKC, but not Aurora kinases, can restore cell polarity in lgl mutants but reveals defects in mitotic spindle orientation in epithelia. We propose that removal of Lgl from the plasma membrane at mitosis allows Pins/LGN to bind Dlg and thus orient the spindle in the plane of the epithelium.

Using functional genomic screening, we identify a set of 26 pre-mRNA splicing factors that are required for sister chromatid cohesion in human cells. Loss of spliceosome subunits increases the dissociation rate of cohesin from chromatin and abrogates cohesion after DNA replication, ultimately causing mitotic catastrophe. Depletion of splicing factors causes defective processing of the pre-mRNA encoding sororin, a factor required for the stable association of cohesin with chromatin, and an associated reduction of sororin protein level. Expression of an intronless version of sororin and depletion of the cohesin release protein WAPL suppress the cohesion defect in cells lacking splicing factors. We propose that spliceosome components contribute to sister chromatid cohesion and mitotic chromosome segregation through splicing of sororin pre-mRNA. Our results highlight the loss of cohesion as an early cellular consequence of compromised splicing.

A single unattached kinetochore can delay anaphase for several hours, but how it is able to block the APC/C throughout the cell is not understood.

GREB1 is shown to be a chromatin-bound ER coactivator and is essential for ER-mediated transcription, because it stabilizes interactions between ER and additional cofactors. We show a GREB1-ER interaction in three xenograft tumors, and using a directed protein-protein approach, we find GREB1-ER interactions in half of ER(+) primary breast cancers. This finding is supported by histological expression of GREB1, which shows that GREB1 is expressed in half of ER(+) cancers, and predicts good clinical outcome. These findings reveal an unexpected role for GREB1 as an estrogen-specific ER cofactor that is expressed in drug-sensitive contexts.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,9.995

Adrenomedullin (AM) is peptide encoded, together with proadrenomedullin N-terminal peptide (PAMP), by the Adm gene (adrenomedullin gene). AM and its putative receptor calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) are implicated in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis during embryogenesis and wound healing, suggesting their possible involvement in secondary lymphedema. To investigate whether AM deficiency predisposes to secondary lymphedema, we used heterozygous adult mice with Adm gene-knockin stop mutation, which selectively abrogated AM, but preserved PAMP, expression (Adm(AM+/Δ) animals). After hind limb skin incision, Adm messenger RNA expression was upregulated in wounded tissue of both Adm(AM+/+) and Adm(AM+/Δ) mice. However, only Adm(AM+/Δ) animals developed limb swelling and histopathological lymphedematous changes, including epidermal thickening, elevated collagen fiber density, and increased microvessel diameter. Secondary lymphedema was prevented when circulating AM levels in Adm(AM+/Δ) mice were restored by systemic peptide delivery. In human skin, CLR was expressed in tissue components affected by lymphedema, including epidermis, lymphatics, and blood vessels. Our study identified a previously unrecognized role for endogenous AM as a key factor in secondary lymphedema pathogenesis and provided experimental in vivo evidence of an underlying germ-line genetic predisposition to developing this disorder.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

We aimed to assess all two-way interactions in breast cancer susceptibility between 70,917 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected primarily based on prior evidence of a marginal effect. Thirty-eight international studies contributed data for 46,450 breast cancer cases and 42,461 controls of European origin as part of a multi-consortium project (COGS). First, SNPs were preselected based on evidence (P < 0.01) of a per-allele main effect, and all two-way combinations of those were evaluated by a per-allele (1 d.f.) test for interaction using logistic regression. Second, all 2.5 billion possible two-SNP combinations were evaluated using Boolean operation-based screening and testing, and SNP pairs with the strongest evidence of interaction (P < 10(-4)) were selected for more careful assessment by logistic regression. Under the first approach, 3277 SNPs were preselected, but an evaluation of all possible two-SNP combinations (1 d.f.) identified no interactions at P < 10(-8). Results from the second analytic approach were consistent with those from the first (P > 10(-10)). In summary, we observed little evidence of two-way SNP interactions in breast cancer susceptibility, despite the large number of SNPs with potential marginal effects considered and the very large sample size. This finding may have important implications for risk prediction, simplifying the modelling required. Further comprehensive, large-scale genome-wide interaction studies may identify novel interacting loci if the inherent logistic and computational challenges can be overcome.","|Journal Article|Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

We have utilised 2 DCIS cell lines, MCF10DCIS.com (ErbB2-normal) and SUM225 (ErbB2-overexpressing) and 7 human primary DCIS samples were cultured in 3D matrigel and as mammospheres in the presence, absence or combination of the Notch inhibitor, DAPT, and ErbB1/2 inhibitors, lapatinib or gefitinib. Western blotting was applied to assess downstream signalling. In this study we demonstrate that DAPT reduced acini size and mammosphere formation in MCF10DCIS.com whereas there was no effect in SUM225. Lapatinb reduced acini size and mammosphere formation in SUM225, whereas mammosphere formation and Notch1 activity were increased in MCF10DCIS.com. Combined DAPT/lapatinib treatment was more effective at reducing acini size in both DCIS cell lines. Mammosphere formation in cell lines and human primary DCIS was reduced further by DAPT/lapatinib or DAPT/gefitinib regardless of ErbB2 receptor status. Our pre-clinical human models of DCIS demonstrate that Notch and ErbB1/2 both play a role in DCIS acini growth and stem cell activity. We report for the first time that cross talk between the two pathways in DCIS occurs regardless of ErbB2 receptor status and inhibition of Notch and ErbB1/2 was more efficacious than either alone.

Client ubiquitination occurs via the action of one or more E3 ubiquitin ligases. We sought to identify the role of Cullin-RING family E3 ubiquitin ligases in the cellular response to HSP90 inhibition. Through a focused siRNA screen of 28 Cullin-RING ligase family members, we found that CUL5 and RBX2 were required for degradation of several HSP90 clients upon treatment of human cancer cells with the clinical HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG. Surprisingly, silencing Cullin-5 (CUL5) also delayed the earlier loss of HSP90 client protein activity at the same time as delaying cochaperone dissociation from inhibited HSP90-client complexes. Expression of a dominant-negative CUL5 showed that NEDD8 conjugation of CUL5 is required for client degradation but not for loss of client activity or recruitment of clients and HSP90 to CUL5.

We now show that mouse Nrf2 contains two binding sites for β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP), which acts as a substrate receptor for the Skp1-Cul1-Rbx1/Roc1 ubiquitin ligase complex. Deletion of either binding site in Nrf2 decreased β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitylation of the transcription factor. The ability of one of the two β-TrCP-binding sites to serve as a degron could be both increased and decreased by manipulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity. Biotinylated-peptide pull-down assays identified DSGIS(338) and DSAPGS(378) as the two β-TrCP-binding motifs in Nrf2. Significantly, our pull-down assays indicated that β-TrCP binds a phosphorylated version of DSGIS more tightly than its non-phosphorylated counterpart, whereas this was not the case for DSAPGS. These data suggest that DSGIS, but not DSAPGS, contains a functional GSK-3 phosphorylation site.

Despite the widespread use of ER(TAM) fusions in vivo, inadequate data are available as to the most efficacious routes for systemic tamoxifen delivery. In this study, we have used two well-characterized ER(TAM) fusion proteins, both reversibly activated by 4-OHT, to compare the effectiveness and kinetics of 4-OHT delivery in mice in vivo by either tamoxifen in food or by intraperitoneal injection.

ADAM17 is implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and cancers such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). As a central mediator of cellular events, overexpressed EGFR is a validated molecular target in HNSCC. However, EGFR inhibition constantly leads to tumour resistance. One possible mechanism of resistance is the activation of alternative EGFR family receptors and downstream pathways via the release of their ligands. Here, we report that treating human HNSCC cells in vitro with a human anti-ADAM17 inhibitory antibody, D1(A12), suppresses proliferation and motility in the absence or presence of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) gefitinib. Treatment with D1(A12) decreases both the endogenous and the bradykinin (BK)-stimulated shedding of HER ligands, accompanied by a reduction in the phosphorylation of HER receptors and downstream signalling pathways including STAT3, AKT and ERK. Knockdown of ADAM17, but not ADAM10, also suppresses HNSCC cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, we show that heregulin (HRG) and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor like growth factor (HB-EGF) predominantly participate in proliferation and migration, respectively. Taken together, these results demonstrate that D1(A12)-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation, motility, phosphorylation of HER receptors and downstream signalling is achieved via reduced shedding of ADAM17 ligands. These findings underscore the importance of ADAM17 and suggest that D1(A12) might be an effective targeted agent for treating EGFR TKI-resistant HNSCC.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,10.75

However, the lack of murine TACE immunoreactivity limits pre-clinical in vivo studies to human xenograft models which are poor analogies to in situ pathology and are not considered clinically predictive. Here, to overcome these limitations, we set out to develop a 'mouse and human cross-reactive' specific anti-TACE antibody. We first re-investigated the originally selected anti-TACE ectodomain phage-display clones, and isolated a lead 'mouse-human cross-reactive' anti-TACE scFv, clone A9. We reformatted scFv-A9 into an IgG2 framework for comprehensive biochemical and cellular characterization and further demonstrated that A9 is an exosite TACE inhibitor. However, surface plasmon resonance analysis and quenched-fluorescent (QF) peptide assay indicated that IgG reformatting of A9 caused low binding affinity and an 80-fold reduction in TACE ectodomain inhibition, severely limiting its efficacy. To address this, we constructed second generation phage-display randomization libraries focused on the complementarity-determining region 3, and carried out affinity selections shuffling between human and mouse TACE ectodomain as antigen in addition to an off-rate selection to increase the chance of affinity improvement. The bespoke 'three-step' selections enabled a 100-fold affinity enhancement of A9 IgG, and also improved its IC50 in a QF peptide assay to 0.2 nM. In human and mouse cancer cell assays, matured A9 IgG showed significant cell-surface TACE inhibition as a monotherapy or combination therapy with chemotherapeutic agent. Collectively, these data suggest that we successfully developed an exosite inhibitor of TACE with sub-nanomolar affinity, which possesses both murine and human immunoreactive properties that can be used for in vivo application in murine pre-clinical cancer models.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,12.834

We show how one dietary compound, the green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), can substantially alter the properties of both the polymeric MUC5B network and monomeric MUC7. Using rate-zonal centrifugation, MUC5B in human whole saliva and MUC5B purified from saliva sedimented faster in the presence of EGCG. The faster sedimentation by EGCG was shown to be greater with increasing MUC5B concentration. Particle tracking microrheology was employed to determine the viscosity of purified MUC5B solutions and showed that for MUC5B solutions of 200-1600 µg/mL, EGCG caused a significant increase in mucin viscosity, which was greater at higher MUC5B concentrations. Visualisation of the changes to the MUC5B network by EGCG was performed using atomic force microscopy, which demonstrated increased aggregation of MUC5B in a heterogeneous manner by EGCG. Using trypsin-resistant, high-molecular weight oligosaccharide-rich regions of MUC5B and recombinant N-terminal and C-terminal MUC5B proteins, we showed that EGCG causes aggregation at the protein domains of MUC5B, but not at the oligosaccharide-rich regions of the mucin. We also demonstrated that EGCG caused the majority of MUC7 in human whole saliva to aggregate. Furthermore, purified MUC7 also underwent a large increase in sedimentation rate in the presence of EGCG. In contrast, the green tea polyphenol epicatechin caused no change in the sedimentation rate of either MUC5B or MUC7 in human whole saliva. These findings have demonstrated how the properties of the mucin barrier can be influenced by dietary components. In the case of EGCG, these interactions may alter the function of MUC5B as a lubricant, contributing to the astringency (dry puckering sensation) of green tea.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,

Correspondingly, mutants of Ire1 that cannot be phosphorylated on the activation loop show decreased specific Xbp1 and promiscuous RNase splicing activity relative to wild-type Ire1 in cells.

Cleavage occurs by a transesterification reaction whereby the 2'-O attacks the adjacent phosphorus with departure of the 5'-O to leave a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate. The structures of both ribozymes are now known. Although the sequences and structures of these ribozymes are generally unrelated, the topological organization and the arrangement of the active sites are the same for both. Both mechanistic and structural data indicate that the ribozymes employ general acid-base catalysis to accelerate the transesterification reactions, using guanine and adenine nucleobases as the general base and acid, respectively, in the cleavage reactions. As a class, the nucleolytic ribozymes all appear to use general acid-base catalysis; guanine nucleobases in particular are very common participants.","|Comparative Study|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,63.714

Coupled to this is our increased ability to generate detailed interactome maps that help to enrich our knowledge of the biological implications of cancer mutations. As a result, network analysis approaches have become an invaluable tool to predict and interpret mutations that are associated with tumour survival and progression. Our understanding of cancer mechanisms is further enhanced by mapping protein structure information to such networks. Here we review the current methodologies for annotating the functional impacts of cancer mutations, which range from analysis of protein structures to protein-protein interaction network studies.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't|Review","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,17.012

Identifying noninvasive biomarkers of early pharmacodynamic responses is important for development of these targeted drugs. As increased aerobic glycolysis is often observed in cancer, we hypothesized that MEK1/2 (MAP2K1/MAP2K2) inhibitors may reduce lactate levels as detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), as a metabolic biomarker for the pharmacodynamic response. MRS was used to monitor intracellular and extracellular levels of lactate in human cancer cells in vitro and in melanoma tumors ex vivo. In addition, we used (1)H MRS and a fluorescent glucose analog to evaluate the effect of MEK inhibition on glucose uptake. MEK1/2 signaling inhibition reduced extracellular lactate levels in BRAF-dependent cells but not BRAF-independent cells. The reduction in extracellular lactate in BRAF-driven melanoma cells was time-dependent and associated with reduced expression of hexokinase-II driven by c-Myc depletion. Taken together, these results reveal how MEK1/2 inhibition affects cancer cell metabolism in the context of BRAF oncogene addiction. Furthermore, they offer a preclinical proof-of-concept for the use of MRS to measure lactate as a noninvasive metabolic biomarker for pharmacodynamic response to MEK1/2 inhibition in BRAF-driven cancers.","|Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,Y,11.036

We show that PTA enhanced surface contrast, but was ineffective at penetrating samples, whereas IKI penetrated more effectively and enhanced contrast after 70 hours of staining. Contrast enhancement was compared when using laboratory and synchrotron based X-ray sources. Using the laboratory source, PT fascicles were tracked and their alignment was measured. Individual ACL fascicles could not be identified, but identifiable features were evident that were tracked. Higher resolution scans of fascicle bundles from the PT and ACL were obtained using synchrotron imaging techniques. These scans exhibited greater contrast between the fascicles and matrix in the PT sample, facilitating the identification of the fascicle edges; however, it was still not possible to detect individual fascicles in the ACL.",|Journal Article,"""Manchester Cancer Research Centre"" OR ""University of Manchester"" OR ""Cancer research UK"" OR ""The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"" AND 2013[dp]:2014[dp]",Center,N,
